influencer and pseudoscience advocate she is the author of the whole pantry mobile app and its later companion cookbook throughout her career as a wellness guru gibson falsely claimed to have been diagnosed with multiple cancer pathologies including brain cancer which she was effectively managing them through diet exercise natural medicine and alternative medicine therapies she falsely claimed she had donated significant proportions of her income and company profits to numerous charities gibson admitted in an april 2015 interview that her claims of having multiple cancers had been fabricated consumer affairs victoria announced legal action against gibson in 2016 and 2017 the federal court of australia supported most of their claims applying a fine of a410000 early life and educationedit annabelle natalie gibson was born on 8 october 1991 in launceston tasmaniacitation needed according to interviews given before she was exposed she left her brisbane family home at age 12 to live with a classmate and later lived with a family friend gibson attended wynnum state high school in wynnum queensland until dropping out in year 10 although she also later claimed to have been homeschooled career and deceitedit gibson worked for some time as a trainee for catering supply company pfd food services in lytton but social media posts show that by late 2008 she had relocated to perth western australia she was involved in the skateboarding culture and actively participated in its online community there gibson moved from perth to melbourne in july 2009 and became a mother one year later at age 18 she launched the whole pantry mobile app in august 2013 at age 21 gibson reportedly told a prospective business partner in 2014 that she had several names that she went under in an interview with the australian women's weekly she said that her mother changed her gibson's name five times gibson's corporate filings indicate that she is three years younger than she has publicly claimed to be the whole pantryedit after gibson launched the whole pantry app it was reportedly downloaded around 200000 times within its first month it was voted apple's best food and drink app of 2013 gibson soon after signed a book deal with lantern books an imprint of penguin books for an accompanying table-top cookbook which was published in october 2014 she further worked with apple inc in september 2014 to transition the app as a privileged pre-installed default third-party inclusion in the apple watch's april 2015 launch by early 2015 it was estimated that more than a1 million had been made in sales of the whole pantry app and book gibson chronicled her battle with cancer on a blog of the same name but doubts about her claims surfaced after she failed to deliver a promised 300000 donation to a charity before doubts were raised about her health and charitable donation claims gibson had intended to expand her brand beyond the app having earlier registered the domain the whole life and advertised in december 2014 to recruit an it specialist to expand the app and brand portfolio both the whole pantry app and the whole life were registered by gibson's partner clive rothwell in her corporate name the whole pantry registration was amended in march 2015 after the controversy broke the whole pantry denied that gibson had helped any person to reject conventional cancer treatment her social media posts have been quoted to allege she had countless times helped others to forgo conventional medical treatment for cancer and to treat themselves naturally as well as leading them down natural therapy for everything from fertility depression bone damage and other types of cancer health claimsedit in interviews gibson claimed to have had brain cancer blood spleen uterine liver and kidney cancers which she falsely attributed to a reaction to the gardasil cervical cancer vaccine when the book was launched in november 2014 gibson claimed in its preface that she had been stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer her story emerged as inconsistent she told media outlets the cancer had reached her liver and kidneys three months earlier she had posted on the whole pantry's facebook page that her cancer had spread to her brain blood spleen and uterus gibson had claimed she had undergone heart surgery several times and to have died momentarily on the operating table she also claimed to have had a stroke however she could not substantiate her medical claims or name the doctors who had diagnosed and treated her gibson did not bear any surgical scars from her purported heart operations gibson's and the whole pantry's statements regarding the benefits of exercise healthy eating and a positive mindset were considered to be uncontroversial being widely acknowledged as conducive to holistic well-being however on her now-deleted instagram account and on other social media gibson also promoted dangerous pseudoscience practices including gerson therapy anti-vaccination and the consumption of non-pasteurised raw milk the controversial gerson therapy from the 1800s had been similarly promoted by another australian wellness blogger jessica ainscough whose funeral gibson attended when ainscough died from cancer in late february 2015 charitable claimsedit as gibson's medical claims were scrutinised allegations emerged that charitable contributions raised in 2013 and 2014 were not given to their intended causes gibson denied the charges but fairfax media stated that she had failed to hand over proceeds solicited in the name of five charities and had grossly overstated the company's total donations to different causes two charities confirmed to the australian newspaper that gibson's company had used their names in fundraising drives but had either failed to deliver the donations or had inadequately accounted for the funds gibson had claimed on several occasions in 2014 that the whole pantry had donated approximately 300000 to charities including maternal healthcare in developing nations medical support for children with cancer and funding schools in sub-saharan africa in late 2014 when the whole pantry app was pre-installed on the apple ipad gibson claimed through her instagram account to be working with twenty different charities gibson claimed in her linkedin professional networking profile established in february 2013 to be a philanthropist in relation to fraud proceedings gibson eventually admitted that she had seriously overstated the charitable contributions that had been made subsequent media reports in march 2015 stated that it could be ascertained that only an estimated 7000 of the previously claimed 300000 had been donated to a total of three charities with at least 1000 of the 7000 reportedly having been donated only after gibson became aware of the fairfax investigation into her earlier claims another 1000 of the 7000 had been donated to a charitable cause under rothwell's name rather than gibson's or the company name also in march 2015 the parents of a young child with brain cancer whom gibson had befriended came forward to report that they had been unaware that gibson had earlier been claiming to be fundraising for their child's treatment on their behalf the family had never received any funds from her or the whole pantry and suspected that gibson had been using information gleaned from the family's experiences to underpin her own claims to have brain cancer concern over publisher culpabilityedit as the controversy grew questions began to be raised about apple penguin and the australian media's lack of due diligence in prima facie accepting gibson's claims of having multiple cancers an issue taken up by the abc's media watch program apple inc in response to media enquiry in march 2015 declined to remove the whole pantry app from sale stating that it was only concerned about the functionality of the app but it was soon after removed from inclusion in the apple watch launch apple subsequently deleted the app from the apple store and removed it from all apple watch promotional material apple did not provide any public information about the reasons for the removal but an internal email from an australian executive to the company's us office acknowledged that the removal would be subject to comment lantern books when approached by investigative journalists said that it had not checked the validity of gibson's cancer claims as this was not required for a cookbook soon after as the controversy grew penguin withdrew the book from sale citing a lack of response from gibson to its queries about the media accusations however fairfax reported that penguin had prior to publication of the book already quizzed and videotaped gibson on her cancer story as recounted in the preface penguin agreed to pay a30000 to the victorian consumer law fund as a penalty for having failed to validate that the book was true elle australia magazine published by bauer media group admitted that following a laudatory december 2014 story on gibson they had received but ultimately dismissed anonymous claims that she was fabricating her story a second bauer magazine cosmopolitan which had awarded gibson its 2014 fun fearless female social media award admitted that it too had received and dismissed a similar email after gibson's confessions the magazine decided not to strip her of the award stating that she had been reader nominated and reader voted however a month earlier cosmopolitan's associate editor had stated that they put forward the nomination myself indicating that the magazine not the public had been instrumental in promoting gibson's award a cancer research professional from the garvan institute of medical research stated publicly that by failing to conduct basic fact checking and providing unfiltered pr to gibson's untested claims an uncritical media had been complicit in her scam attempted clean-up and defenceedit once the controversy surfaced in the media the whole pantry began removing any comments made on its since-deleted facebook page that questioned gibson's claims asserting that these comments only added to the misinformation of the initial fairfax article this selective deletion drew even more criticism posts that gibson had made on her instagram account that made reference to her cancers or charitable donations were also selectively deleted soon after all posts were deleted from gibson's and the whole pantry's instagram accounts around the same time individual postings about gibson's cancer and claims of having died briefly while under heart surgery were also being selectively deleted by the administrator of her blog at the request of a user accounts across a number of social media platforms were soon either abandoned made private or deleted in their entirety gibson subsequently established another facebook account under an alias which was used to defend her work and counter what she called bullying of herself and family she wrote that she would shortly publish an open letter admission of deceitedit in february 2015 gibson's close friend chanelle mcauliffe confronted gibson with suspicions about her cancer claims and perpetrating a scam she urged gibson to come forward with the truth but gibson refused concerned about the harm gibson was causing to people with cancer mcauliffe reported gibson to the police a lawyer and an investigative journalist they were not willing to look into the case finally journalists at the age recognised mcauliffe as a legitimate whistleblower and broke the first story of gibson's fraud in march 2015 after reports identified gibson's fraudulent claims regarding her charitable donations media investigation found that she had also fabricated her stories of cancer and lied about her age personal life and history concerns were expressed that gibson had led a profligate lifestyle by renting an upmarket town house leasing a luxury car and office space undergoing cosmetic dental procedures purchasing designer clothes and holidaying internationally she paid all of these expenses using money she claimed to have raised for charity with a collapsing social media support base gibson admitted in an april 2015 interview that her claims of having multiple cancers had been fabricated stating that none of it's true she gave an interview to the australian women's weekly in which she admitted to having fabricated all her cancer claims she attributed her deceit to her upbringing specifically to neglect by her now-estranged mother claiming to having been forced to take care of herself and her brother since the age of five the interview was described as an admission of deceit without expression of regret or apology gibson's women's weekly interview was arranged by bespoke approach and gibson was provided pro bono representation by the company during the interview in a may 2015 interview with the same magazine gibson's mother natalie dal-bello refuted several claims gibson had made about her family including the false claim that her brother was autistic legal actionedit on 6 may 2016 consumer affairs victoria announced legal action against gibson and inkerman road nominees pty ltd originally known as belle gibson pty ltd for false claims by ms gibson and her company concerning her diagnosis with terminal brain cancer her rejection of conventional cancer treatments in favour of natural remedies and the donation of proceeds to various charities the regulator said it had conducted an in-depth investigation of gibson's activities and applied to australia's federal court for leave to pursue legal action gibson's publisher penguin australia agreed to pay 30000 to the victorian consumer law fund as a penalty for releasing the whole pantry without fact checking on 15 march 2017 the federal court of australia supported most of those claims concluding that ms gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer gibson was fined 410000 which she has not paid as of 2025 but the judge accepted gibson's story that she was acting out of delusion rather than criminal intent federal court justice debra mortimer delivered the decision that most but not all of the claims against gibson were proven gibson did not appear in court for the decision justice mortimer found that gibson's claims had been misleading and deceptive and that ms gibson had no reasonable basis to believe she had cancer from the time she began making these claims in public to promote the whole pantry book and the apps in mid-2013 but there was not enough evidence to prove that she was not acting out of delusion gibson's actions were described by dr mark feldman a clinical professor of psychiatry who coined the term münchausen's by internet as particularly predatory as well as deceit on a grand scale for personal profit in september 2017 gibson was fined 410000 for making false claims about her donations to charity as of april 2019update gibson had not yet paid the fine and authorities were seeking power to charge her with contempt of court a new trial was set for 14 may and she faced 6 years in jail if she did not attend as of mid-september 2019 gibson still had not paid claiming to be broke and consumer affairs victoria were still seeking to enforce the penalty in a 2017 letter later released by the federal court gibson had stated that she was 170000 in debt and had 5000 to her name on 22 january 2020 the sheriff's office of victoria conducted a search warrant at gibson's home in northcote and seized items to recoup gibson's unpaid fines which due to interest and costs exceeded half a million dollars in february 2021 the federal court registrar marked her case as abandoned her home was subject to a second warrant on 21 may 2021 to try to recoup her unpaid fines as of february 2025 gibson has not paid her outstanding fines claimed adoption into oromo communityedit on 23 january 2020 the day after the first raid a shabo media video from october 2019 surfaced in which gibson was wearing a headscarf and speaking partially in the oromo language referring to herself as sabontu discussing the political situation in ethiopia with an interviewer and referring to ethiopia as back home she professed to have been adopted by the ethiopian community in melbourne after volunteering for four years calling the adoption a gift from allah however on the same day the president of the australian oromo community association in victoria tarekegn chimdi stated that gibson was not a registered volunteer is not a community member and she's also not working with the community and that he had seen her at events only two or three times he said that nobody seemed to know who she was and he had only just learned of her backstory and wished her to stop saying she was part of the community in popular mediaedit gibson is portrayed by kaitlyn dever in the

respectivelyto oaxaca mexico to stop the illegal sale of classified items stolen by the serpent society a rogue special-ops team led by sidewinder they recover the items but sidewinder escapes torres is excited to be taking on wilson's former mantle but wilson is hesitant to involve torres in dangerous missions due to the pair not having superpowers like former captain america steve rogers after the mission wilson and torres train with isaiah bradley a super soldier who was imprisoned and experimented on by the us government ross invites wilson and torres to a summit with world leaders at the white house and wilson accepts on the condition that bradley is also invited ross asks wilson to help him reform the avengers during the summit ross explains that a new metal adamantium has been discovered on celestial island which was formed when the celestial tiamut emerged in the indian ocean the recovered items were the first refined samples of the metal and were stolen from a japanese mining operation to avoid an arms race ross proposes a treaty to govern adamantium's mining and distribution as he is talking the song mr blue plays and causes several men including bradley to begin shooting at ross and other dignitaries apprehended by ross's head of security former black widow ruth bat-seraph the men regain their senses and deny any knowledge of the attack while investigating wilson is ambushed by sidewinder and captures him torres tracks a call on sidewinder's phone to a hidden black site in west virginia called camp echo one ross tries to salvage the treaty but the japanese government blames him for the theft of their adamantium and the subsequent white house attack ross realizes that the mastermind behind these events is dr samuel sterns who gained advanced intelligence after being exposed to bruce banner's blood during the abomination's rampage through harlem ross imprisoned sterns at camp echo one publicly blamed him for the abomination's actions and promised to release him if sterns helped advance him to the presidency wilson and torres find sterns and learn how he uses technology and the song mr blue to control minds he escapes while they are fighting mind-controlled soldiers bat-seraph investigates camp echo one herself and helps wilson and torres they meet with wilson's military friend dennis dunphy who has sidewinder in custody wilson learns enough from sidewinder to deduce sterns's plan to destroy ross's reputation wilson torres and bat-seraph go to celestial island where ross and the prime minister of japan are racing to claim ownership of adamantium sterns controls the minds of two american pilots who attack the japanese fleet wilson and torres intercept the planes and convince the japanese to stand down torres is critically injured in the fight ross tells wilson that he is dying of heart failure and had sterns develop pills that have prolonged his life ross refused to release sterns for fear that he would no longer make the pills leading to sterns's anger and plans for revenge wilson is consoled by his friend bucky barnes sterns kills dunphy who discovered that the pills have been adding gamma radiation to ross's body and surrenders himself to wilson sterns's arrest and connection to ross are publicly revealed while the latter is at a press conference ross loses control of his emotions and transforms into a red hulk destroying part of the white house wilson attempts to calm him down by reminding him of visits to washington dc's cherry blossom trees with his estranged daughter betty the two fight until they are exhausted and ross reverts to normal later bradley is exonerated wilson invites a recovering torres to join the avengers and the treaty is ratified ross resigns and has himself incarcerated at the raft where wilson and betty visit him in a post-credits scene an imprisoned sterns warns wilson of a coming attack from other worlds cast anthony mackie as sam wilson captain americaan avenger and former pararescueman who was trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially-designed wing pack producer nate moore said wilson's captain america is an underdog similar to rocky balboa from the rocky film series because he does not have the abilities or allies of the previous captain america steve rogers he has to earn the mantle after claiming it without support director julius onah said the film would show wilson stepping up to be the leader as captain america mackie said wilson would not be a judgmental captain america and has a different understanding of good and evil with a focus on listening compassion and counseling he likened his performance to the tupac shakur song hit 'em up 1996 since wilson is not a super soldier like rogers he uses captain america's shield and his wingsuitboth made from the fictional metal vibraniumto level the playing field in fights to prepare for the film's action sequences mackie focused on yoga and pilates routines to improve his flexibility and core strength danny ramirez as joaquin torres falcona first lieutenant in the us air force who takes on wilson's former mantle of falcon using a similar wing pack mackie said wilson and torres have an equal friendship in contrast with wilson's admiration of rogers and dislike of bucky barnes in previous mcu projects though torres looks up to wilson as an inspiration mackie gave ramirez advice on wearing the falcon costume shira haas as ruth bat-seraphan israeli former black widow who serves as president thaddeus ross's security advisor moore said the character's perspective on ross puts her on a collision course with wilson and onah described her as a great part of the tapestry of the film's paranoid thriller story she is briefly seen wearing a suit that resembles the comic book character's white and blue costume but it is partly concealed under a jacket carl lumbly as isaiah bradleyan african-american korean war veteran and super soldier who was imprisoned and experimented on for 30 years in the film samuel sterns takes control of bradley's mind and frames him for an assassination attempt on president ross leading to bradley's arrest this begins further exploration of the injustices that bradley has faced in his life he is released and exonerated at the end of the film thanks to wilson's actions xosha roquemore as leila taylora secret service agent working for president ross who has a history with wilson taylor is a romantic interest for wilson in the comics but the film does not indicate any romantic interest between the characters giancarlo esposito as seth voelker sidewinderthe leader of the serpent society a violent special-ops team esposito described sidewinder as an intelligent badass he said the physicality of the role differentiated sidewinder from his character gus fring of the breaking bad franchise who is also an intelligent antagonist and he was excited to show his physicality on screen esposito does not wear a comics-accurate snake-themed costume in the film but wanted to include some references to the comic book costume by including some of the colors from that version in his film costume esposito's eyes were also changed to be blue to match the comic version of sidewinder liv tyler as betty rossa cellular biologist and thaddeus ross's estranged daughter who resents her father for his obsessive pursuit of bruce banner hulk years prior onah said it was a no-brainer to bring tyler back from the film the incredible hulk 2008 and he said she was central to president ross's storyline in the film in the final cut betty is often mentioned but she is only heard on a phone call and then briefly appears in the final scene tim blake nelson as samuel sternsa cellular biologist who was accidentally cross-contaminated with banner's blood during the events of the incredible hulk gaining superhuman intelligence the character's inclusion was one of the reasons onah was interested in the film feeling that someone who operates from intellect would be a good adversary for wilson nelson was satisfied with what the writers conceived for what sterns had been doing since the incredible hulk with the character being imprisoned and exploited by thaddeus ross nelson said portraying sterns's pathos and rage required him to grow up as an actor the character is generally depicted in the comics as having a large head to accommodate an expanded brain he has a more grotesque appearance in the film with parts of his brain seemingly bursting from his skull one eye glowing green and the other clouded and seemingly blind practical effects were used for the character per nelson's request as he wanted to have the deformation visible on set for himself and the other actors to experience harrison ford as thaddeus ross red hulkthe newly elected president of the united states who wants to work with captain america ross who was previously a us army general and then the us secretary of state in the mcu transforms into red hulk in the film ford portrays red hulk through motion capture moore said there would be natural sparks between wilson and ross due to the events of the film captain america civil war 2016 but producer kevin feige said their dynamic is changed now that they are captain america and president respectively marvel studios was excited for ross to become red hulk considering the character's history of hunting for banner with moore stating turning a guy who hunted hulks into a hulk himself makes him more than an antagonist it makes him a tragic character ford replaces william hurt who portrayed ross in the mcu from 2008 to 2021 before his death in march 2022 before he died marvel studios informed hurt of their plans to have ross become red hulk and he had been eager to portray that aspect of the character additionally sebastian stan reprises his mcu role as bucky barnes in a cameo appearance barnes is campaigning to be a congressman setting up his role in the film thunderbolts 2025 also appearing are jóhannes haukur jóhannesson as copperhead a member of the serpent society william mark mccullough as dennis dunphy a us military commander and ally to wilson and takehiro hira as japanese prime minister ozaki production development see also the falcon and the winter soldier marvel studios president kevin feige said in october 2015 that captain america civil war 2016 was the conclusion of the captain america trilogy starring chris evans as steve rogers captain america after captain america the first avenger 2011 and captain america the winter soldier 2014 civil war was evans's last contracted standalone captain america film but he was open to extending his contract beyond the marvel cinematic universe mcu crossover films avengers infinity war 2018 and avengers endgame 2019 in january 2021 evans was reportedly close to signing a deal to return as rogers in at least one project evans's involvement was said to be similar to how fellow mcu star robert downey jr had supporting roles as tony stark iron man in other mcu films following the iron man trilogy evans said the report was news to him anthony mackie at the 2019 san diego comic-con announcing the series the falcon and the winter soldier in which his character sam wilson accepts the mantle of captain america this film is a continuation of the series starring mackie by october 2018 marvel studios was developing a limited series for disney starring anthony mackie's sam wilson falcon and sebastian stan's bucky barnes winter soldier from the mcu films malcolm spellman was hired as head writer of the series which was officially announced as the falcon and the winter soldier in april 2019 after rogers bequeaths his shield and the mantle of captain america to wilson in endgame the series shows wilson accepting the mantle and coming to terms with the implications of that as a black man before the series premiered mackie said there had been no discussions regarding a second season and he was not sure when he would next appear in an mcu film because of the covid-19 pandemic series director kari skogland was also unsure whether there would be a second season saying she told the story she wanted to with the first season but there were more stories and characters to explore if a second was made executive producer nate moore said the series had evergreen topics that lent themselves to further exploration and set up ideas for a potential second season feige said there were ideas for what another one could be but marvel intended for the series to lead into an mcu film first as they did with fellow disney miniseries wandavision 2021 after the series finale of the falcon and the winter soldier one world one people was released in april 2021 spellman and series writer dalan musson were revealed to be writing a fourth captain america film that continues wilson's story evans's reported return as rogers was expected to come in a different project mackie said he was unaware of any plans for a film or second season but he was excited to see what happened next and said it would be monumental for him to headline an mcu film particularly as a black actor mackie negotiated a deal to star in the film over the next few months and officially signed on in august he later said he had been excited to make a second season of the falcon and the winter soldier with stan and their co-star daniel brühlwho portrays helmut zemoand was disappointed by the pivot to starring in a film without them although stan makes a cameo appearance in the film pre-production julius onah was hired to direct the film in july 2022 mackie said it would feature a new story and new characters rather than be a direct continuation of the falcon and the winter soldier and onah said wilson would no longer be conflicted about being captain america that question has been resolved sam is our captain america now at san diego comic-con later in july the film's title was revealed to be captain america new world order and it was given a release date of may 3 2024 making it part of phase five of the mcu the subtitle which is also the name of the first episode of the falcon and the winter soldier was noted for its use in politics professional wrestling and various conspiracy theories along with antisemitic rhetoric and was deemed to be a controversial choice several cast members were announced at the d23 expo in september danny ramirez as joaquin torres falcon and carl lumbly as isaiah bradley both reprising their roles from the falcon and the winter soldier tim blake nelson as samuel sterns returning from the second mcu film the incredible hulk 2008 and israeli actress shira haas as the comic book character sabra nelson was glad to return after years of disappointment over a sequel to the incredible hulk not being produced onah described new world order as a paranoid thriller and said filming would begin in early 2023 the announcement that sabra an israeli superheroine would be adapted for the film led to criticisms from some people who believed this would lead to negative stereotypical portrayals of palestinians and arabs in the comics sabra is a member of the mossad and some of the arab characters she interacts with were perceived to be misogynistic antisemitic and violent the name sabra also has different meanings to israeli jews and palestinians the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel criticized the use of the character and called the comic book version's valorization of mossad and perceived racism against palestinians sickening yousef munayyer a palestinian-american writer and analyst felt the character could not have a positive role in the film based on her depiction in the comics and said turning israeli spies into heroes was insensitive and disgraceful in response marvel studios said the film was taking a new approach to the character just as other comics characters had been re-imagined for modern audiences when brought into the mcu this led to concerns from some other groups that marvel was erasing the character's israeli background which the american jewish committee ajc compared to making captain america canadian in the film the character is a former black widow and high-ranking us government official named ruth bat-seraph the name sabra is not used nor is she a mutant or mossad agent but the character is depicted as a first-generation israeli has an israeli accent and moore said she has the attitude and the essence of the comics character he reiterated that the character's backstory was not changed in response to public concerns and explained that using the black widow program to adapt characters who marvel studios didn't want to translate as one-to-one from the comics was a general idea that came up during the making of the film black widow 2021 the character's inclusion prompted some calls to boycott the film in part due to the israelhamas war some supporters of israel took issue with the character having allegiance to the us government while some who are critical of israel protested the film's use of the character due to her depiction in the comics with confirmation that the character would still be depicted as israeli in the film the ajc and the anti-defamation league adl both praised the decision harrison ford plays new us president thaddeus ross in the film replacing william hurt who portrayed ross in the mcu until his death in march 2022 in october 2022 moore was revealed to be producing new world order alongside feige harrison ford was cast as thaddeus thunderbolt ross that month replacing william hurt who portrayed the character in the mcu until his death in march 2022 ford was reported to be appearing as ross in this film as well as the following mcu film thunderbolts 2025 marvel studios considered changing course with ross's role in the film's story following hurt's death believing no actor would want to take over from hurt during that time ford reached out to feige about possibly joining the mcu and agreed to take on the role without seeing a script ford saw playing ross as an opportunity to honor what hurt had done with the character and also continue with a character arc that he had enjoyed from the previous films in the film ross becomes the president of the united states and eventually finds himself at odds with wilson amidst a global conspiracy moore drew comparisons to the 2017 comic book storyline secret empire he noted that wilson wears a costume featuring the colors of the american flag while facing off with the president and said the film's story was about the notion of a guy who believes an ideal realizing that ideal is not always held up to the same standards by other people and feeling really betrayed by where the american government has gone onah drew comparisons to ford's film clear and present danger 1994 which features a similar conspiracy involving the president he wanted to feature themes of bringing people together and focusing on shared experiences believing these were central to captain america and sam wilson's character which he thought had political resonance but was more about humanity than politics marvel studios was supportive of this despite feige joking about onah trying to save america with the film also discussing parallels with real-world politics ford said similarities between ross and any real presidents were coincidental and his focus was on the character's own history personality and circumstances from onah's first conversations about the film the serpent societya group of snake-themed villains in the comicswas planned to be included this paid off a joke marvel made years earlier when announcing the third captain america film as captain america serpent society before revealing its true subtitle to be civil war moore acknowledged that the team can come across as goofy but he considered them to be part of captain america's all-time hall of fame villain groups and the creatives wanted to treat them seriously moore compared the film's version described as a violent special-ops team to the more grounded version of the comic book character batroc the leaper that is introduced in the winter soldier portrayed by georges st-pierre pre-production work at trilith studios in atlanta georgia began on november 7 ahead of a planned filming start in march 2023 gersha phillips was the costume designer and ramsey avery was the production designer after working on the mcu films guardians of the galaxy vol 2 2017 and spider-man homecoming 2017 xosha roquemore joined the cast in january 2023 mackie expected to begin work on march 1 his captain america costume was redesigned from the one seen in the falcon and the winter soldier which was based on the mostly-white costume that wilson is known for wearing as captain america in the comics the new costume for brave new world is mostly dark blue with red and white accents closer to the costumes evans wore in the winter soldier and other films the cowl that mackie wore for the falcon and the winter soldier was removed at his request as he struggled with the heat the sweat the fogged-up glasses and said it was his worst nightmare ryan meinerding marvel studios' head of visual development worked on the costume in march washington dc's office of cable television film music and entertainment said marvel studios would be filming in the city that june filming principal photography began on march 21 2023 at trilith studios in atlanta georgia under the working title rochelle rochelle kramer morgenthau served as cinematographer onah wanted the film's action to be grounded and tactile and give wilson things to do that were not seen in his previous appearances avery reiterated that their intent was for the film to be more grounded in reality than recent mcu films had been liv tyler joined the cast by the end of march 2023 reprising her role of betty ross from the incredible hulk at that time julia louis-dreyfus was expected to reprise her mcu role as valentina allegra de fontaine in the film the start of the 2023 writers guild of america strike in may 2023 was not expected to impact production of the film with marvel studios reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the film's already scheduled reshoots later in may set photos revealed that seth rollins was part of the cast and led to speculation that he was portraying a member of the serpent society in june marvel studios announced the new title captain america brave new world jeremy mathai at film praised the change saying it strikes a far more optimistic perspective than new world order doubling as a commentary on the future of the famous superhero in the marvel cinematic universe and as a statement on some very overdue representation the change was also deemed to be a wise decision by collider's hilary remley who noted that the original title could have been interpreted as having antisemitic connotations moore explained that marvel studios felt new world order was really interesting and sort of moody and scary for a subtitle and was not intended to represent real-world issues the studio decided to change the title after receiving feedback about how the phrase new world order had been co-opted in the real world in a way that made people uncomfortable at the time of the new subtitle's announcement onah was revealed to have co-written the script with spellman the film's release date was soon delayed to july 26 2024 location filming took place in washington dc and the city's cherry blossom trees are seen throughout the film filming moved to washington dc by the end of june the cherry blossom trees that are planted around the city are featured throughout the film including during wilson's fight with ross at the end of the film after the latter transforms into red hulk onah said he had vivid memories of the cherry blossoms from the time he lived near dc in arlington virginia as a child and to him they aligned with the film's themes of empathy since they were gifts to the us from japan mackie said filming in dc brought his mcu experience full circle with the production staying at the same hotel and filming in the same areas as they did for his first mcu film the winter soldier filming for brave new world wrapped on june 30 post-production by october 2023 there was potential for brave new world to return to its may 2024 release date because it was further along in production than marvel studios' deadpool wolverine 2024 which had taken over that date however this was considered unlikely and brave new world's release was instead delayed to february 14 2025 following the 2023 sag-aftra strike's conclusion in november 2023 journalist jeff sneider reported that the film was not received well in an early test screening that three major sequences were being cut and that extensive reshoots were planned from january 2024 until that may or june in december matthew orton was hired to write additional material for the reshoots which were then scheduled to last from early-to-mid-2024 orton previously worked on the marvel studios miniseries moon knight 2022 the same day rosa salazar was revealed to have been cast in the film mark ruffalo stated in february 2024 that he was reprising his mcu role as bruce banner hulk in the film adam b vary of variety soon reported that ruffalo was not appearing in the film explaining that the actor had misspoken when he was asked about the film and had just intended to express enthusiasm for its upcoming release vary noted that there had been ongoing speculation about ruffalo potentially appearing in the film due to the number of characters from the incredible hulk already included along with ross's transformation into red hulk in april feige and mackie described the film as a grounded action thriller with no aliens more similar in tone to the winter soldier than some recent mcu films mackie added that viewers did not need to have seen the incredible hulk to watch the film saying brave new world was a reset of the mcu that establishes new themes and antagonists for the universe moving forward giancarlo esposito joined the film as sidewinder leader of the serpent society during reshoots that began in may 2024 his casting was part of efforts to refine the film's political thriller tone and also bring more gravitas to the serpent society team giancarlo esposito revealed in may 2024 that he had been cast in an mcu role and would be appearing sooner rather than later with his character being teased in a film before a bigger role in an mcu television series he was confirmed to be appearing in brave new world at the end of the month as part of the reshoots which began at that time in atlanta and were scheduled to last for 22 days these were expected to be less extensive than the reshoots for the mcu films doctor strange in the multiverse of madness 2022 and the marvels 2023 focusing on new action sequences and integrating esposito brave new world was also expected to be much less expensive than the marvels which cost more than 300 million nelson returned to atlanta for reshoots in june and said they redid much of his original work mackie characterized the reshoots as just adding a few additional scenes to enhance the film and said there was no retooling or remaking moore said the reshoots were focused on creating the perfect political thriller tone and the casting of esposito was part of this he believed the actor made the film more grounded despite his heightened material similar to his role in the television series the mandalorian 20192023 ford salazar and takehiro hira also participated in the reshoots in july the remains of tiamutthe celestial whose emergence on earth was halted by the eternals in the mcu film eternals 2021were revealed to be a focus of the film's story allowing the introduction of the fictional metal adamantium to the mcu moore said marvel studios had been waiting to address tiamut's remains in a story that could make the best use of them esposito announced that he was portraying seth voelker sidewinder leader of the serpent society and said he would return for additional reshoots in mid-november in december 2024 marvel credited the story to spellman musson and rob edwards while onah peter glanz and orton received screenplay credit jóhannes haukur jóhannesson was revealed to be part of the cast and salazar was reported to be portraying diamondback a member of the serpent society this confirmed speculation that she was playing the character based on her appearance in set photos rollins stated in january 2025 that he would no longer be appearing in the film following the rewrites and reshoots onah confirmed that rollins was cast as a member of the serpent society and explained that he was replaced with esposito's character during reshoots onah felt esposito's inclusion was a no-brainer once he became available and thought the actor brought the right level of gravitas to the film and the serpent society team salazar's scenes as diamondback were also cut from the final version of the film jóhannesson plays another member of the serpent society in the film copperhead appearing alongside esposito onah said esposito's role in the film was great setup for further appearances of the serpent society in the mcu the film's final writing credits were also revealed in january edwards received screenplay credit alongside the writing teams of spellman musson and onah glanz with the story credited to edwards spellman and musson additional off-screen literary material was attributed to michael kastelein jeph loeb orton and zeb wells matthew schmidt and madeleine gavin edited the film schmidt previously worked on the winter soldier and civil war brave new world is the first mcu film to not feature an animated marvel studios opening logo instead presenting the studio's logo in no-nonsense black-and-white without a traditional musical fanfare alessandro ongaro was the visual effects supervisor with visual effects provided by wētā fx digital domain luma pictures barnstorm vfx upp opsis and outpost vfx wētā fx designed red hulk with meinerding wētā visual effects supervisor dan cox said they explored various design aspects from the comic books and did not want the character to just look like a color-swapped version of the hulk they hoped to make him more intimidating than the hulk with a more upright athletic posture onah wanted the character to feel more tactical and methodical due to ross's military background and referenced a bear for poses where the character is on all fours ford's facial features were incorporated into the design based on scans of his face the climactic confrontation between red hulk and captain america in washington dc has more than 300 visual effects shots music main article captain america brave new world soundtrack laura karpman was announced as the film's composer in august 2024 karpman previously composed the music for the mcu series what if 20212024 and ms marvel 2022 and the film the marvels nora kroll-rosenbaum who worked with karpman on what if provided additional music for the film a soundtrack album featuring their music was released by hollywood records and marvel music on february 12 2025 at that time mackie said the film's title-song had been provided by kendrick lamar which was interpreted as lamar having written a new song for the film however it is his 2014 song i that is played over the film's end credits additionally the 1959 song mr blue by the fleetwoods is heard throughout the film as a trigger for characters being mind-controlled by sterns this is a reference to his mr blue alias in the incredible hulk marketing feige and mackie revealed the first footage from the film focusing on wilson meeting with thaddeus ross at cinemacon in april 2024 the following month mcdonald's began selling happy meals with toys based on characters from the film including red hulk and diamondback stephanie kaloi at thewrap noted that these characters had not been confirmed for the film by marvel at that time and the early reveal was likely due to the film's release being delayed but the marketing partnership with mcdonald's not being pushed back to match more footage from the film was shown at a cineeurope panel in june teasing disney's theatrical slate a teaser trailer was released in july which drew comparisons to the winter soldier's tone with jennifer ouellette of ars technica describing it as half-superhero movie half-political thriller the appearance of red hulk and the character's potential true identity were both widely discussed adam chitwood at thewrap wondered if rumors of thaddeus ross becoming red hulk were a red herring the verge's charles pulliam-moore questioned if the film being a continuation of the falcon and the winter soldier would be difficult for general audiences to follow conversely sandy schaefer and chris evangelista from film felt the film would not rely much on the series to have wider audience appeal they called the trailer pretty good considering the film recently completed reshoots noting that it largely contains action rather than plot details commentators also noted the reveal that the remains of tiamut would be featured in the film after the emergence had largely been ignored in mcu projects since eternals michael mcwhertor at polygon noted that the trailer shows the united states and other countries meeting at a global unity summit to discuss the celestial with a stylized version of tiamut's hand being used as a logo for the summit later in july marvel released an updated version of the teaser for distribution in theaters that removed isaiah bradley's assassination attempt on thaddeus ross this came following the attempted assassination of donald trump in pennsylvania that month also in july 2024 feige and members of the cast promoted the film at san diego comic-con more footage was shown esposito's role was announced and thaddeus ross was confirmed to be the character who transforms into red hulk similar footage was also shown at the 2024 d23 expo following online leaks of the san diego comic-con and d23 footage marvel released an official look at red hulk within their video celebrating the company's 85th anniversary in august a full trailer for the film debuted at d23 brasil in november and was also released online after the teases of red hulk in previously released footage the trailer features ross's transformation into red hulk and shots of the character fighting wilson several commentators noted the trailer's unique style featuring creepy black lines split-screen shots and a flickering text effect comparisons were drawn to political thriller films such as the candidate 1972 the day of the jackal 1973 the parallax view 1974 all the president's men 1976 jfk 1991 and the constant gardener 2005 jordan king at empire questioned whether brave new world would live up to these comparisons but said it was a promising sign that the film was looking to place itself in conversation with those previous films marvel studios partnered with tide's collateral stains promotional campaign to release a series of commercials for the film in january 2025 these feature gregg turkington reprising his role of baskin-robbins store manager dale from the mcu films ant-man 2015 and ant-man and the wasp quantumania 2023 for the three weeks leading up to the film's premiere disney was said to be making a final and biggest marketing push for it at a press event in italy at the end of january mackie said captain america represented values like honor dignity and integrity rather than america itself he received backlash from some online commentors who labeled the film anti-american and woke mackie soon added i'm a proud american and taking on the shield of a hero like cap is the honor of a lifetime cap has universal characteristics that people all over the world can relate to james hibberd of the hollywood reporter said evans made similar statements when playing the character and the actors were likely directed by marvel to focus on captain america's universal qualities to avoid any jingoistic connotations while promoting internationally hibberd also discussed the film's other controversiessimilarities between thaddeus ross and the newly re-elected president donald trump the original new world order subtitle opposing views on the inclusion and portrayal of ruth bat-seraph and ugly criticisms related to mackie being blackbut said these did not appear to have impacted the film's box office performance based on early projections coinciding with the film's release in february concept art by meinderding of the film's captain america costume and design for red hulk were used as variant covers for marvel comics' sam wilson captain america 2 and red hulk 1 release captain america brave new world premiered at the tcl chinese theatre in hollywood los angeles on february 11 2025 and was released in the united states on february 14 in imax the film was previously scheduled for may 3 2024 and then july 26 2024 before it was pushed to the february 2025 release date following the 2023 sag-aftra strike it is part of phase five of the mcu reception box office as of february 23 2025update captain america brave new world has grossed 1412 million in the united states and canada and 1482 in other territories for a worldwide total of 2894 million deadline hollywood reported that the film needed to earn 425 million worldwide to break-even taking into account the reported production budget of 180 million as well as marketing costs in the united states and canada the film was released alongside paddington in peru and was projected to gross 8094 million from 4105 theaters in its four-day opening weekend tracking service quorum reported early box office estimates for the film in mid-january 2025 projecting that it would earn 8695 million during its opening weekend and more than 100 million across the four-day weekend from valentine's day to presidents' day this was similar to the winter soldier's 95 million opening weekend in 2014 further tracking reported later in january similarly indicated an opening of at least 90 million the film grossed 40 million on its opening day including an estimated 12 million from thursday previews it debuted to 885 million and a total of 100 million over the four-day frame topping the box office in its second weekend it grossed

overseas markets in its opening weekend the top five international markets were china 105 million the uk 85 million mexico 66 million korea 56 million and france 47 million critical response captain america brave new world received poor reviews on review aggregator rotten tomatoes 49 of 302 critics gave brave new world a positive review and an average rating of 5510 the critics consensus reads anthony mackie capably takes up cap's mantle and shield but brave new world is too routine and overstuffed with uninteresting easter eggs to feel like a worthy standalone adventure for this new avengers leader the website also reported that the first reviews were mixed and that critics thought the film was a bit too self-serious without packing a real political punch but it delivers enough exciting action and solid performances metacritic summarized the critical response as mixed or average based on a weighted average score of 42 out of 100 from 56 critics audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of b on an a to f scale the lowest grade for an mcu film and posttrak reported an average rating of 3 out of 5 stars the political subject matter was a subject of critical commentary the hollywood reporter invoked that the scene where ross transformed into red hulk and caused havoc across washington dc seemed like a fantasy of real-world us president donald trump indiewire wrote in agreement with the maga parallel between ross and trump both being gruff old men elevated to office based on the promise of facilitating unity based on dealing with an alien threat the independent said that while ross red hulk could be interpreted as a trump pastiche this was ultimately unlikely as the film refused to establish a political stance with subplots regarding politics remaining underused rolling stone's david fear joked that ross was somehow still only the second-most destructive rage-filled commander in chief to ever hold office and entertainment weekly writer maureen lee lenker joked that the most unbelievable part is a us president with empathy a sense of responsibility for his actions and a capacity for change the new york times wrote that the only wisps of tangible political intrigue to be found were either unintended or from allusions to previous subject matter in falcon and the winter soldier other commentary concerned the controversial bat-seraph character with the forward writing that the controversy about the character relating to israel and gaza did not matter because the film overall was honestly such a dog's breakfast in terms of politics and presentation while film opined that the character's debut could not have been timed more poorly because of the divisiveness of public opinion inherent in the ongoing conflict the characterization and narrative were criticized screen rant said that the only purpose of sam's suit switch from white to blue was to sell more toys pointing this out as an example of the film featuring elements without flare nor concern for furthering its story or characters the new york times likewise wrote that it amounted to the genre of the action-figure commercial vulture wrote that the film marked marvel's turn into a giant slop machine opining that the film's bid to create sincerity came off as phony and that the jokes to cut this up were lame while the hollywood reporter agreed that humor was in severely short supply and that mackie's reliable charisma was lacking thewrap wrote that the film was unoriginal and without emotional depth even in the few moments where wilson made an emotional connection to the film as these moments only rehashed the plot of falcon and the winter soldier briefly and without impact it said that brave new world's steadfast refusal to engage with its own ideas either by artistic design or corporate mandate reeks of timidity rogerebertcom wrote that wilson was turned into the magical negro and that in an effort to soothe white america's anger and hurt the film also asks its hero to grin and figuratively tap dance off screen collider said the dialogue was among the worst present in the whole of the mcu and criticized the boringness of wilson sidewinder and bat-seraph though praised ford's empathy they pointed out the non-cohesive nature of the film mentioning the reshoots the film underwent as resulting in this in agreement on the topic of ford entertainment weekly said ford was the main attraction lauding his gravitas and twinkle in his eye and a merry warmth the independent called the character development an afterthought feeling mackie had little to play with emotionally and criticized his relegation to a functional blandly heroic punching machine despite his acting talent the wall street journal's kyle smith said that the film is competently executed without resorting to played-out gimmickry such as skipping across the multiverse adding that it gives the audience plenty of analogues for real-world problems he also wrote that the mcu draws on the manchurian candidate to produce one of its better recent movies while katie walsh of the los angeles times described the film as a decent political thriller with something culturally resonant to say that exceeds mere comic-book particulars critics were polarized on the visuals for the new york post the white house fight scene had so cheap and cheesy animation that it was unable to be taken seriously and that the reveal of the mutated sterns caused a hearty guffaw because of the poor makeup and prosthetics collider wrote that the cgi in the film was worse than the incredible hulk 2008 released nearly two decades earlier and concluded it was unconvincing vulture's bilge ebiri wrote that the vfx-heavy sequences are so lifeless and tiresome that i felt my eyes drifting closed a couple of times rogerebertcom and screen rant both praised the vfx on red hulk though screen rant felt the cherry blossoms were a green screen mess the new york times wrote that the visuals were garish and slapdash while thewrap called the visuals drab and unfinished criticizing wilson's cgi wings as a proof of concept that proves nothing they wrote that the film looked so clean it looks completely fake the hollywood reporter wrote the cgi was underwhelming and at other times even worse but were amused from recognizing ford's features in red hulk richard roeper of the chicago sun-times gave the film 3 of 4 stars and called it a far better work than recent mcu missteps future in january 2025 mackie said he wanted to continue portraying wilson for around 10 years he was hopeful about making another captain america film after his roles in the next two avengers films avengers doomsday 2026 and avengers secret wars 2027 notes as depicted in the

southern us states of texas louisiana mississippi alabama and florida which border the gulf on the north are occasionally referred to as the third coast of the united states in addition to its atlantic and pacific coasts but more often as the gulf coast the gulf of mexico took shape about 300 million years ago mya as a result of plate tectonics the gulf of mexico basin is roughly oval and is about 810 nmi 1500 kilometres 930 miles wide its floor consists of sedimentary rocks and recent sediments it is connected to part of the atlantic ocean through the straits of florida between the us and cuba and with the caribbean sea via the yucatán channel between mexico and cuba because of its narrow connection to the atlantic ocean the gulf has very small tidal ranges the size of the gulf basin is about 16 million km2 620000 sq mi almost half of the basin consists of shallow continental shelf waters the volume of water in the basin is roughly 24 million cubic kilometres 580 thousand cubic miles the gulf is one of the most important offshore petroleum production regions in the world making up 14 of the united states' total production moisture from the gulf of mexico also contributes to weather across the united states including severe weather in tornado alley name gulf of america redirects here for the russian waters formerly known as the gulf of america see nakhodka bay for the coastline along the southern us see gulf coast of the united states as with the name of mexico the gulf's name is associated with the ethnonym mexica which refers to the nahuatl-speaking people of the valley of mexico better known as the aztecs in aztec religion the gulf was called chalchiuhtlicueyecatl or house of chalchiuhtlicue after the deity of the seasdisputed discuss believing that the sea and sky merged beyond the horizon they called the seas ilhuicaatl meaning sky water contrasting them with finite landlocked bodies of water such as lakes the maya civilization which used the gulf as a major trade route likely called the gulf nahá meaning great water early european 16th-century maps such as those by juan de la cosa and martin waldseemüller depicted the eastern extremity of the gulf though left it unlabeled hernán cortés called it sea of the north spanish mar del norte in his dispatches while other spanish explorers called it the gulf of florida golfo de florida or gulf of cortés golfo de cortés a 1584 map by abraham ortelius also labeled it as the sea of the north mare de nort other early european maps called it the gulf of st michael latin sinus s

the great bay of mexicoan english nautical chart dated 1775 labels it the bay of mexico now glossing mexico as an alternative name for new spain the name gulf of mexico spanish golfo de méxico french golphe du mexique later golfe du mexique first appeared on a world map in 1550 and a historical account in 1552 as with other large bodies of water europeans named the gulf after mexico land of the mexica because mariners needed to cross the gulf to reach that destination this name has been the most common name since the mid-17th century when it was still considered a spanish sea french jesuits used this name as early as 1672 in the 18th century spanish admiralty charts similarly labeled the gulf as mexican cove or mexican sound ensenada mexicana or seno mexicano until the republic of texas

between the dry tortugas and the mainland being considered to be within the gulf population the total population of the five us states facing the gulf is 67 million people of these a total of 158 million people live in the gulf coastal region in counties directly bordering the gulf the six mexican states that face the gulf have a total population of 191 million people three provinces of northwest cuba including havana border on the gulf with a combined population of 3211000 by 1975 400 offshore drilling rigs in the gulf hosted a temporary population of more than 10000 workers on any given day who were rotated on a weekly staggered schedule increasing automation later led to a decline in the offshore worker population geology the consensus among geologists is that before the late triassic the gulf of mexico did not exist before the late triassic the area consisted of dry land which included continental crust that now underlies yucatán within the middle of the supercontinent pangaea this land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central mexico through the marathon uplift in west texas and the ouachita mountains of oklahoma and to alabama where it linked directly to the appalachian mountains it was created by the collision of continental plates that formed pangaea as interpreted by roy van arsdale and randel t cox this mountain range was breached in the late cretaceous by the formation of the mississippi embayment ship and oil rigs in the gulf the rifting that created the basin was associated with zones of weakness within pangaea including sutures where the laurentia south american and african plates collided to create it first there was a late triassicearly jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds second the continental crust was stretched and thinned as rifting progressed through early and middle jurassic times this thinning created a broad zone of transitional crust which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust which is half the typical 40 km 25-mile thickness of continental crust at this time rifting first created a connection to the pacific ocean across central mexico and later eastwards to the atlantic ocean this flooded the opening basin to create an enclosed marginal sea the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of louann salt and associated anhydrite evaporites during the late jurassic continued rifting widened the basin and progressed to the point that seafloor spreading and formation of oceanic crust occurred at this point sufficient circulation with the atlantic ocean was established that the deposition of louann salt ceased seafloor spreading stopped at the end of the jurassic about 145150 myacantarell fieldduring the late jurassic through early cretaceous the basin experienced a period of cooling and subsidence of the crust underlying it the subsidence resulted from crustal stretching cooling and loading initially the crustal stretching and cooling combination caused about 57 km 3143 miles of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust the basin expanded and deepened because subsidence occurred faster than sediment could fill it later loading of the crust within the basin and adjacent coastal plain by the accumulation of kilometers of sediments during the rest of the mesozoic and all of the cenozoic further depressed the underlying crust to its current position about 1020 km 62124 miles below sea level particularly during the cenozoic a time of relative stability for the coastal zones thick clastic wedges built out the continental shelf along the northwestern and northern margins of the basinsediment in the gulf to the east the stable florida platform was not covered by the sea until the latest jurassic or the beginning of cretaceous time the yucatán platform was emergent until the mid-cretaceous after both platforms were submerged the formation of carbonates and evaporites has delineated the geologic history of these two stable areas most of the basin was rimmed during the early cretaceous by carbonate platforms and its western flank was involved during the latest cretaceous and early paleogene periods in a compressive deformation episode the laramide orogeny which created the sierra madre oriental of eastern mexico in 2014 erik cordes of temple university and others discovered a brine pool 3300 feet 1000 m below the gulf's surface with a circumference of 100 feet 30 m and 12 feet 37 m deep which is four to five times saltier than the rest of the water the first exploration of the site was unmanned using hercules and in 2015 a team of

gulf of mexico was used as a trade route off the coast of the yucatán peninsula and present-day veracruz spanish exploration although europeans credited the spanish voyage of christopher columbus with the discovery of the americas the ships in his four voyages did not reach the gulf of mexico instead the spanish sailed into the caribbean around cuba and hispaniola the first alleged european exploration of the gulf of mexico was by amerigo vespucci in 1497 vespucci is purported to have followed the coastal land mass of central america before returning to the atlantic ocean via the straits of florida between florida and cuba however this first voyage of 1497 is widely disputed many historians doubt that it took place as described in his letters vespucci described this trip and once juan de la cosa returned to spain a famous world map was produced in 1506 hernán cortés participated in the conquest of hispaniola and cuba receiving a large estate of land and enslaving indigenous people for his efforts in 1510 he accompanied diego velázquez de cuéllar an aide to the governor of hispaniola on his expedition to conquer cuba in 1518 velázquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of mexico for colonization in 1517 francisco hernández de córdoba discovered the yucatán peninsula this was the first european encounter with an advanced civilization in the americas with solidly built buildings and complex social structures which they found comparable to those of the old world they also had reason to expect that this new land would have gold all of this encouraged two further expeditions the first in 1518 under the command of juan de grijalva and the second in 1519 under the command of hernán cortés which led to the spanish exploration military invasion and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the conquest of mexico hernández did not live to see the continuation of his work he died in 1517 the year of his expedition as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage and disappointed in the knowledge that velázquez had given precedence to grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to yucatán in 1523 a treasure ship was wrecked en route at padre island texas when word of the disaster reached mexico city the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and sent ángel de villafañe from mexico city marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels villafañe traveled to pánuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site which that community had already visited he arrived in time to greet garcía de escalante alvarado a nephew of pedro de alvarado commander of the salvage operation when alvarado arrived by sea on 22 july 1554 the team laboured until 12 september to salvage the padre island treasure this loss combined with other ship disasters around the gulf of mexico led to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern gulf coast to protect shipping and rescue castaways more quickly as a result the expedition of tristán de luna y arellano was sent and landed at pensacola bay on 15 august 1559 on 11 december 1526 charles v of the holy roman empire granted pánfilo de narváez a licence to establish colonial settlements along the present-day gulf coast of the united states known as the narváez expedition the contract gave him one year to gather an army leave spain be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast on 7 april 1528 they spotted land north of what is now tampa bay they turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbour the master pilot miruelo knew of sometime during these two days one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast but nothing else is known in 1697 french sailor pierre le moyne d'iberville was chosen by the minister of marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the mississippi river and to settle louisiana which french explorer robert cavelier de la salle named the english-coveted region in 1682 to honour king louis xiv of france d'iberville's fleet sailed from brest on 24 october 1698 reaching santa rosa island near pensacola founded by the spanish on 25 january of the following year he sailed from there to mobile bay and explored massacre island he cast anchor between cat island and ship island on 13 february he went to the mainland biloxi with his teenage brother jean-baptiste le moyne de bienville completed fort maurepas on the northeast side of the bay of biloxi on 1 may three days later d'iberville sailed for france leaving his brother jean-baptiste as second in command to the french commandant the first permanent settlement fort maurepas now ocean springs mississippi was founded in 1699 by d'iberville by then the french had also built a small fort at the mouth of the mississippi at a settlement they named la balise or la balize seamark in french

shelf up to 350 nautical miles 650 km 400 mi into the western polygon since this would extend mexico's continental shelf well into territory claimed by the united states mexico and the united states

zone that runs eastwest along the texaslouisiana coastline in july 2008 researchers reported that between 1985 and 2008 the area roughly doubled in size it was 22730 km 14120 miles in 2017 the largest ever recorded poor agricultural practices in the northern portion of the gulf of mexico have led to a tremendous increase of nitrogen and phosphorus in neighboring marine ecosystems which has resulted in algae blooms and a lack of available oxygen occurrences of virilization and estrogen suppression were observed as a result a 2007 study of the atlantic croaker found a disproportioned sex ratio of 61 males to 39 females in hypoxic sites this was compared with a 52 to 48 male-female ratio found in reference sites showing impaired reproductive output for fish populations inhabiting hypoxic

overall water temperature of the gulf between hurricanes katrina and rita although katrina cooled waters in its path by up to 4 c 72 f they had rebounded by the time of rita's appearance moisture from the gulf of mexico is a primary factor for the development of tornadoes and other severe weather in tornado alley a term used to describe an area of the united states that is one of the most tornado-prone areas in the world dry air from the rocky mountains converges with gulf moisture in the area which produces storms and supercells that produce some of the most violent tornadoes in the world a study published in the journal of climate by dongmin kim sang-ki lee and hosmay lopez found that the maddenjulian oscillation strengthens the north american low-level jet which increases the flow of gulf moisture and atmospheric instability into the central united states furthering tornadogenesis in the region the gulf's warm sea surface temperatures can feed powerful deadly and destructive atlantic hurricanes such as 2005's hurricane katrina in the open atlantic a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation however the gulf is shallower when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds enough to support

williams sisters has been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour serena holds a combined 39 major titles 23 in singles 14 in women's doubles and two in mixed doubles placing her joint-third on the all-time list and second in the open era for total major titles she is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major

2020 the tennis channel ranked williams as the greatest female tennis player in history early life williams was born on september 26 1981 in saginaw michigan to oracene price and richard williams she is the youngest of price's five daughters after half-sisters yetunde lyndrea and isha price and full older sister venus she also has at least seven paternal half-siblings when the children were young the family moved to compton california where she started playing tennis at the age of four her father home-schooled her and venus while he and her mother have been her official coaches her other mentors have included richard williams a compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded the venus and serena williams tennis tutorial academy venus and serena williams right at a pam shriver event in baltimore 1993 when williams was nine she and her family moved from compton to west palm beach florida so she could attend the tennis academy of rick macci who provided her with additional coaching macci did not always agree with williams's father but respected that he treated his daughters like kids allowed them to be little girls by 1991 williams had a 463 record on the united states tennis association junior tour and was ranked no 1 among under-10 players in florida when williams was 10 richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments as he wanted them to go slowly and focus on school and because he wanted to ensure they would not burn out before turning professional experiences of racism also influenced this decision as he had heard white parents talk about the williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments in 1995 when williams was in the ninth grade her father pulled his daughters out of macci's academy and took

bourbon street on january 1 2025 in which 15 people were killed and dozens were injured delaying the 2025 sugar bowl at the superdome to the following day tourism official walt leger iii said on new

super bowl lviii brett goldberg co-owner of tickpick suggested new orleans's relatively low hotel capacity was a factor in the sharp decline but that chiefs fatigue was also a factor i think if the

out of the house without being subjected to the game both commissioner roger goodell and referees association executive director scott green have denied accusations of wrongdoing with goodell suggesting that the notion of games being rigged or fixed in the chiefs' favor is a ridiculous theory not to be taken seriously the boycott despite not having a visible impact on overall national

braden mann the chiefs' drive began on their own 12 following a 5-yard return by nikko remigio quarterback patrick mahomes completed his first pass 11 yards to juju smith-schuster for a first down after a 1-yard pass and two incomplete throws matt araiza punted 58 yards from the chiefs' 24 the punt was returned 13 yards by cooper dejean setting the eagles up at their 31 to begin their second drive subsequently the eagles put together a 7-play 69-yard touchdown drive that included a 20-yard pass to dallas goedert although jahan dotson caught a pass that was initially signaled a touchdown he was ruled short of the goal line regardless jalen hurts scored with a quarterback sneak using the team's signature tush push play for a 1-yard touchdown after another punt by the chiefs the eagles got to the chiefs' 30-yard line on an 11-play drive that ended with an interception thrown by hurts to bryan cook at the chiefs' 2-yard line at the start of the second quarter despite this the chiefs went three-and-out again and after a jake elliott 48-yard field goal mahomes threw an interception to dejean who returned it 38 yards for a touchdown both teams then traded punts before mahomes threw another interception to zack baun shortly after the two-minute warning which set up a 12-yard touchdown pass from hurts to brown extending the eagles' lead to 240 before halftime second half deandre hopkins pictured in september 2020 caught a touchdown and a two-point conversion pass for the chiefs in the fourth quarter the second half began with an eagles kickoff which resulted in a touchback despite gaining a first down with a pass to xavier worthy mahomes was sacked twice in the next two plays and the chiefs' drive stalled at their own 37 the eagles responded by driving down the field 69 yards including a 16-yard and 14-yard run by hurts which ended with a 29-yard field goal from jake elliott the chiefs' next drive took them five plays and 17 yards to their own 47-yard line facing a fourth down a pass from mahomes to deandre hopkins fell incomplete after it was batted away by avonte maddox resulting in a turnover on downs on the next play hurts threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to devonta smith increasing the eagles' score to 34 the chiefs responded with a 24-yard touchdown pass from mahomes to worthy at the end of the third quarter but failed a two-point conversion attempt from mahomes to tight end travis kelce in the fourth quarter after a 48-yard field goal from elliott mahomes fumbled the ball on a strip sack by milton williams which was recovered by williams himself at the chiefs' 18-yard line although an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was called on williams elliott converted a 50-yard field goal attempt making the score 406 on the next drive mahomes threw a 7-yard pass to deandre hopkins for a touchdown the corresponding 2-point conversion from mahomes to justin watson was successful the eagles proceeded to bench their starters and allowed their backups to play and take snaps in the final minutes of the game and after the eagles turned the ball over on downs mahomes responded with a 50-yard touchdown pass to worthy and another successful 2-point conversion with a pass to hopkins cutting the chiefs' deficit to 18 points for a 4022 score a subsequent onside kick was recovered by the eagles who ran out the clock game statistics philadelphia outperformed kansas city on both sides of the ball philadelphia quarterback jalen hurts who was ultimately named super bowl mvp completed 17 of 22 attempts for 221 yards threw an interception and scored three touchdowns two passing one rushing he also rushed for 72 yards setting a new record for quarterback rushing yards in the super bowl hurts had set the prior record of 70 yards in super bowl lvii the eagles were less successful on the ground their star running back saquon barkley rushed 25 times for 57 yards averaging 23 yards per carry in what was statistically speaking one of his worst games of the season nevertheless barkley's super bowl performance was enough for him to break terrell davis's record for combined single-season and postseason rushing yards with 2504 analysts praised the eagles defense particularly the defensive line for stifling patrick mahomes and the chiefs offense mahomes was sacked six times threw two interceptions and lost a fumble he finished the game with 257 passing yards and three touchdowns in the first half the chiefs scored no points and only gained 23 yards the lowest first-half yardage since the new england patriots in super bowl xx and the second-lowest overall the eagles did not blitz during the game which was noted as a sign of the defensive line's success super bowl lix was also noted for its quality rookie play philadelphia rookie cornerback cooper dejean intercepted a pass from mahomes and returned it for a touchdown becoming the second rookie in super bowl history to achieve a pick-six after reggie phillips in super bowl xx which was also played at the superdome as well as the first player in super bowl history to score a touchdown on his birthday kansas city rookie wide receiver xavier worthy set the rookie record for receiving yards and touchdowns in the super bowl with 157 and 2 respectively he also became the first rookie to record 150 or more receiving yards in any playoff game box score super bowl

triangular theory of love vte saint valentine valentine's day also called saint valentine's day or the feast of saint valentine is celebrated annually on february 14 it originated as a christian feast day honoring a martyr named valentine and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in many regions of the world there are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various saint valentines connected to february 14 including an account of the imprisonment of saint valentine of rome for ministering to christians persecuted under the roman empire in the third century according to an early tradition saint valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love tradition maintains that saint valentine performed weddings for christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry by the roman emperor an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer's daughter a letter signed your valentine as a farewell before his execution the 8th-century gelasian sacramentary recorded the celebration of the feast of saint valentine on february 14 the day became associated with romantic love in the 14th and 15th centuries when notions of courtly love flourished apparently by association with the lovebirds of early spring in 18th-century england it grew into an occasion for couples to express their love for each other by presenting flowers offering confectionery and sending greeting cards known as valentines valentine's day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline doves and the figure of the winged cupid in the 19th century handmade cards gave way to mass-produced greetings in italy saint valentine's keys are given to lovers as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver's heart as well as to children to ward off epilepsy called saint valentine's malady it is a day of commemoration in the anglican communion and the lutheran church many parts of the eastern orthodox church celebrate saint valentine's day on july 6 in honor of roman presbyter saint valentine and on july 30 in honor of hieromartyr valentine the bishop of interamna modern terni saint valentine main article saint valentine history shrine of st valentine in whitefriar street carmelite church in dublin ireland numerous early christian martyrs were named valentine the valentines honored on february 14 are valentine of rome valentinus presb m romae and valentine of terni valentinus ep interamnensis m romae valentine of rome was a priest in rome who was martyred in 269 and was buried on the via flaminia the relics of saint valentine were kept in the church and catacombs of san valentino in rome which remained an important pilgrim site throughout the middle ages until the relics of saint valentine were transferred to the church of santa prassede during the pontificate of nicholas iv 12881292 the flower-crowned skull of saint valentine is exhibited in the basilica of santa maria in cosmedin rome other relics are found at whitefriar street carmelite church in dublin ireland valentine of terni became bishop of interamna now terni in central italy and is said to have been martyred during the persecution under emperor aurelian in 273 he is buried on the via flaminia but in a different location from valentine of rome his relics are at the basilica of saint valentine in terni basilica di san valentino professor jack b oruch of the university of kansas notes that abstracts of the acts of the two saints were in nearly every church and monastery of europe a relic claimed to be saint valentine of terni's head was preserved in the abbey of new minster winchester and venerated the catholic encyclopedia speaks of a third saint named valentine who was mentioned in early martyrologies under date of february 14 he was martyred in africa with a number of companions but nothing more is known about him february 14 is celebrated as saint valentine's day in various christian denominations it has for example the rank of commemoration in the calendar of saints in the anglican communion the feast day of saint valentine is given in the calendar of saints of the lutheran church in the 1969 revision of the roman catholic calendar of saints the feast day of saint valentine on february 14 was relegated from the general roman calendar to particular local or even national calendars for the following reason though the memorial of saint valentine is ancient it is left to particular calendars since apart from his name nothing is known of saint valentine except that he was buried on the via flaminia on february 14 therefore as he remains within the roman martyrology he may be recognised optionally during mass outside of christmastide and eastertide the feast day is still celebrated in balzan malta where relics of the saint are claimed to be found and also throughout the world by traditionalist catholics who follow the older pre-second vatican council calendar see general roman calendar of 1960 in the eastern orthodox church saint valentine is recognized on july 6 on which saint valentine the roman presbyter is honoured in addition the eastern orthodox church observes the feast of hieromartyr valentine bishop of interamna on july 30 legends st valentine baptizing st lucilla jacopo bassano jc cooper in the dictionary of christianity writes that saint valentine was a priest of rome who was imprisoned for succouring persecuted christians contemporary records of saint valentine were most probably destroyed during this diocletianic persecution in the early 4th century in the 5th or 6th century a work called passio marii et marthae published a story of martyrdom for saint valentine of rome perhaps by borrowing tortures that happened to other saints as was usual in the literature of that period the same events are found in bede's martyrology which was compiled in the 8th century it states that saint valentine was persecuted as a christian and interrogated by roman emperor claudius ii in person claudius was impressed by valentine and had a discussion with him attempting to get him to convert to roman paganism in order to save his life valentine refused and tried to convert claudius to christianity instead because of this he was executed before his execution he is reported to have performed a miracle by healing julia the blind daughter of his jailer asterius the jailer's daughter and his forty-six member household family members and servants came to believe in jesus and were baptized a later passio repeated the legend adding that pope julius i built a church over his sepulchre it is a confusion with a 4th-century tribune called valentino who donated land to build a church at a time when julius was a pope the legend was picked up as fact by later martyrologies starting with bede's martyrology in the 8th century it was repeated in the 13th century in the golden legend there is an additional embellishment to the golden legend which according to henry ansgar kelly was added in the 18th century and widely repeated on the evening before valentine was to be executed he is supposed to have written the first valentine card himself addressed to the daughter of his jailer asterius who was no longer blind signing as your valentine the expression from your valentine was later adopted by modern valentine letters this legend has been published by both american greetings and the history channel saint valentine of terni and his disciples john foxe a 16th-century english historian and the order of carmelites state that saint valentine was buried in the church of saint praxedes in rome located near the cemetery of saint hippolytus this order says that according to legend julia herself planted a pink-blossomed almond tree near his grave today the almond tree remains a symbol of abiding love and friendship another embellishment suggests that saint valentine performed clandestine christian weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry the roman emperor claudius ii supposedly forbade this in order to grow his army believing that married men did not make for good soldiers however george monger writes that this marriage ban was never issued and that claudius ii told his soldiers to take two or three women for themselves after his victory over the goths according to legend in order to remind these men of their vows and god's love saint valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment giving them to these soldiers and persecuted christians a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on saint valentine's day saint valentine supposedly wore a purple amethyst ring customarily worn on the hands of christian bishops with an image of cupid engraved in it a recognizable symbol associated with love that was legal under the roman empire roman soldiers would recognize the ring and ask him to perform marriage for them probably due to the association with saint valentine amethyst has become the birthstone of february which is thought to attract love folk traditions while the european folk traditions connected with saint valentine and saint valentine's day have become marginalized by modern customs connecting the day with romantic love there are still some connections with the advent of spring while the custom of sending cards flowers chocolates and other gifts originated in the uk valentine's day still remains connected with various regional customs in england in norfolk a character called jack valentine knocks on the rear door of houses leaving sweets and presents for children although he was leaving treats many children were scared of this mystical person in slovenia saint valentine or zdravko was one of the saints of spring the saint of good health and the patron of beekeepers and pilgrims a proverb says that saint valentine brings the keys of roots plants and flowers start to grow on this day it has been celebrated as the day when the first work in the vineyards and in the fields commences it is also said that birds propose to each other or marry on that day another proverb says valentin prvi spomladin 'valentine the first spring saint' as in some places especially white carniola saint valentine marks the beginning of spring valentine's day has only recently been celebrated as the day of love the day of love was traditionally march 12 saint gregory's day or february 22 saint vincent's day the patron of love was saint anthony whose day has been celebrated on june 13 connection with romantic love possible ancient origins the feast latin in natali lit 'on the birthday' of saint valentine originated in christendom and has been marked by the western church of christendom in honour of one of the christian martyrs named valentine as recorded in the 8th-century gelasian sacramentary in ancient rome lupercalia was observed february 1315 on behalf of pan and juno pagan gods of love marriage and fertility it was a rite connected to purification and health and had only slight connection to fertility as a part of health and none to love the celebration of saint valentine is not known to have had any romantic connotations until chaucer's poetry about valentine's day in the 14th century some seven hundred years after celebration of lupercalia is believed to have ceased lupercalia was a festival local to the city of rome the more general festival of juno februa meaning juno the purifier or the chaste juno was celebrated on february 1314 although the pope gelasius i 492496 article in the catholic encyclopedia says that he abolished lupercalia theologian and methodist minister bruce forbes wrote that no evidence has been demonstrated to link saint valentine's day and the rites of the ancient roman purification festival of lupercalia despite claims by many authors to the contrarynotes 2 some researchers have theorized that gelasius i replaced lupercalia with the celebration of the purification of the blessed virgin mary and claim a connection to the 14th century's connotations of romantic love but there is no historical indication that he ever intended such a thingnotes 3 also the dates do not fit because at the time of gelasius i the feast was only celebrated in jerusalem and it was on february 14 only because jerusalem placed the nativity of jesus christmas on january 6notes 4 although it was called purification of the blessed virgin mary it also dealt with the presentation of jesus at the temple jerusalem's purification of the blessed virgin mary on february 14 became the presentation of jesus at the temple on february 2 as it was introduced to rome and other places in the sixth century after gelasius i's time while sometimes repeated uncritically by modern sources that men or boys drew names of women or girls from a jar to couple for the duration of lupercalia there is no ancient evidence for any kind of lottery or sortition scheme pairing couples for sex the first descriptions of this fictitious lottery appeared in the 15th century in relation to valentine's day with a connection to the lupercalia first asserted in 18th century antiquarian works such as those by alban butler the lives of the fathers martyrs and other principal saints 17561759 and francis douce these modern sources claimed that the fictional lupercalia was the source of the practice of sending valentines the practice of sending valentines originated in the middle ages with no link to lupercalia with boys drawing the names of girls at random this custom was combated by priests for example by frances de sales around 1600 apparently by replacing it with a religious custom of girls drawing the names of apostles from the altar however this religious custom is recorded as early as the 13th century in the life of saint elizabeth of hungary so it could have a different origin chaucer's parliament of fowls geoffrey chaucer by thomas hoccleve 1412 the first recorded association of saint valentine's day with romantic love is believed to be in the parliament of fowls 1382 by geoffrey chaucer a dream vision portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates honouring the first anniversary of the engagement of fifteen-year-old king richard ii of england to fifteen-year-old anne of bohemia chaucer wrote in middle english for this was on seynt valentynes daywhan every foul cometh there to chese his makeof every kynde that men thynke mayand that so huge a noyse gan they makethat erthe and eyr and tre and every lakeso ful was that unethe was there spacefor me to stonde so ful was al the place in modern english for this was on saint valentine's daywhen every fowl comes there to choose his matchof every kind that men may think ofand that so huge a noise they began to makethat earth and air and tree and every lakewas so full that not easily was there spacefor me to standso full was all the place readers have uncritically assumed that chaucer was referring to february 14 as saint valentine's day henry ansgar kelly has observed that chaucer might have had in mind the feast day of st valentine of genoa an early bishop of genoa who died around ad 307 it was probably celebrated on may 3 a treaty providing for richard ii and anne's marriage the subject of the poem was signed on may 2 1381 jack b oruch notes that the date on which spring begins has changed since chaucer's time because of the precession of the equinoxes and the introduction of the more accurate gregorian calendar only in 1582 on the julian calendar in use in chaucer's time february 14 would have fallen on the date now called february 23 a time when some birds have started mating and nesting in england chaucer's parliament of fowls refers to a supposedly established tradition but there is no record of such a tradition before chaucer the speculative derivation of sentimental customs from the distant past began with 18th-century antiquaries notably alban butler the author of butler's lives of saints and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars most notably the idea that valentine's day customs perpetuated those of the roman lupercalia has been accepted uncritically and repeated in various forms up to the present three other authors who made poems about birds mating on st valentine's day around the same years otton de grandson from savoy john gower from england and a knight called pardo from valencia chaucer most probably predated all of them but due to the difficulty of dating medieval works it is not possible to ascertain which of the four may have influenced the others court of love the earliest description of february 14 as an annual celebration of love appears in the charter of the court of love the charter allegedly issued by charles vi of france at mantes-la-jolie in 1400 describes lavish festivities to be attended by several members of the royal court including a feast amorous song and poetry competitions jousting and dancing amid these festivities the attending ladies would hear and rule on disputes from lovers no other record of the court exists and none of those named in the charter were present at mantes except charles's queen isabeau of bavaria who may well have imagined it all while waiting out a plague valentine poetry the earliest surviving valentine is a 15th-century rondeau written by charles duke of orléans to his wife which commences je suis desja d'amour tanné ma tres doulce valentinée charles d'orléans rondeau vi lines 12 at the time the duke was being held in the tower of london following his capture at the battle of agincourt 1415 the earliest surviving

invention of the postage stamp penny black saw the number of valentines posted increase with 400000 sent just one year after its introduction and ushered in the less personal but easier practice of mailing valentines that made it possible for the first time to exchange cards anonymously which is taken as the reason for the sudden appearance of racy verse in an era otherwise prudishly victorian production increased cupid's manufactory as charles dickens termed it with over 3000 women employed in manufacturing the laura seddon greeting card collection at manchester metropolitan university

bowl iii the first four super bowls from 1967 to 1970 were played prior to the merger with the nfl and afl each winning two after the merger in 1970 the 10 afl teams and three of the nfl teams formed

the second-largest event for american food consumption behind thanksgiving dinner with fans commonly purchasing beer hot dogs nachos and other concessions spending an average of 58 on food and drinks during an nfl game originedit the first super bowl at los angeles memorial coliseum since the turn of the 20th century college football teams from across the united states have scheduled bowl games against each other the original bowl game was the rose bowl game in pasadena california which was first played in 1902 as the tournament eastwest football game as part of the pasadena tournament of roses in 1923 the tournament east-west football game moved to the new rose bowl stadium the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the tournament of roses and that it was shaped like a bowl much like the yale bowl in new haven connecticut the tournament of roses football game thus eventually came to be known as the rose bowl game exploiting the rose bowl game's popularity post-season college football contests were created for miami the orange bowl new orleans the sugar bowl and el paso the sun bowl in 1935 and for dallas the cotton bowl in 1937 by the time the first super bowl was played the term bowl for any major american football game was well established the packers defeated the chiefs in the first aflnfl championship game for four decades after its 1920 inception the nfl successfully fended off several rival leagues in 1960 it encountered its most serious competitor when the american football league afl was formed the afl vied with the nfl for players and fans after the afl's inaugural season afl commissioner joe foss sent an invitation to the nfl on january 14 1961 to schedule a world playoff game between the two leagues' champions beginning with the upcoming 1961 season the first world playoff game if actually played would have matched up the afl champion houston oilers against the nfl champion green bay packers in the mid-1960s lamar hunt owner of the afl's kansas city chiefs first used the term super bowl to refer to the aflnfl championship game in the merger meetings hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a super ball toy a vintage example of the ball is on display at the pro football hall of fame in canton ohio in a july 25 1966 letter to nfl commissioner pete rozelle hunt wrote i have kiddingly called it the 'super bowl' which obviously can be improved upon the leagues' owners chose the name aflnfl championship game but in july 1966 the kansas city star quoted hunt in discussing the super bowlthat's my term for the championship game between the two leagues and the media immediately began using the term although the league stated in may 1967 that not many people like it asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as merger bowl summit bowl and the game the associated press reported that super bowl grew and grew and grewuntil it reached the point that there was super week super sunday super teams super players ad infinitum super bowl became official beginning with the third annual game roman numerals are used to identify each super bowl rather than the year in which it is held since the fifth edition in january 1971 the sole exception to this naming convention tradition occurred with super bowl 50 played on february 7 2016 following the 2015 season the following year the nomenclature returned to roman numerals for super bowl li the new york jets were the first afl team to win a super bowl iii upsetting the baltimore colts after the nfl's green bay packers won the first two super bowls some team owners feared for the future of the merger at the time many doubted the competitiveness of afl teams compared with their nfl counterparts though that perception changed when the afl's new york jets defeated the heavily favored nfl contender baltimore colts in super bowl iii in miami one year later the afl's kansas city chiefs defeated the nfl's minnesota vikings 237 in super bowl iv in new orleans which was the final aflnfl world championship game played before the merger beginning with the 1970 season the nfl realigned into two conferences the former afl teams plus three nfl teams the baltimore colts pittsburgh steelers and cleveland browns would constitute the american football

packers won the first two aflnfl world championship games later renamed super bowls defeating the kansas city chiefs and oakland raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons respectively the packers were led by quarterback bart starr who was named the most valuable player mvp for both games these two championships coupled with the packers' nfl championships in 1961 1962 and 1965 amount to the most successful stretch in nfl history five championships in seven years and the second threepeat in nfl history 1965 1966 and 1967 the packers are the only team to threepeat as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era 1929 1930 and 1931 the first playoff game in the nfl was in 1932 in super bowl iii the afl's new york jets defeated the 195-point favorite baltimore colts of the nfl 167 the jets were led by quarterback joe namath who had said that he guaranteed a jets win before the game and former colts head coach weeb ewbank and their victory demonstrated that the afl was competitive with the nfl this was reinforced the following year when the chiefs defeated the nfl's vikings 237 in super bowl iv 1970s dominant franchisesedit after the aflnfl merger was completed in 1970 three franchisesthe cowboys miami dolphins and steelerswould go on to dominate the 1970s winning a combined eight super bowls between them in the decade with the steelers winning four of the

unprecedented four championships in six years the cowboys coming back from a loss the previous season won super bowl vi over the dolphins however this would be the dolphins' final loss for over a year as the next year the dolphins would go 140 in the regular season and eventually win all their playoff games capped off with a 147 victory in super bowl vii becoming the first and only team in the super bowl era to finish an entire perfect regular and postseason undefeated the dolphins would repeat as league champions by winning super bowl viii a year later with a 247 win over the minnesota vikings in the mid to late 1970s the steelers became the first nfl dynasty of the post-merger era by winning four super bowls ix x xiii and xiv in six years they were led by head coach chuck noll the play of offensive stars terry bradshaw franco harris lynn swann john stallworth and mike webster and their dominant steel curtain defense led by mean joe greene l c greenwood ernie holmes mel blount jack ham and jack lambert many of the team's key players were selected in the 1974 draft in which pittsburgh selected four future hall of famers the most for any team in any sport in a single draft a fifth player donnie shell was signed by pittsburgh after going unselected in the 1974 nfl draft he too was later enshrined in the hall of fame the steelers were the first team to win three and then four super bowls and appeared in six afc championship games during the decade making the playoffs in eight straight seasons pittsburgh still remains the only team to win back-to-back super bowls twice and four super bowls in a six-year period the steelers' 1970s dynasty was interrupted only by the raiders' first super bowl win in super bowl xi and the cowboys' second super bowl win in super bowl xii conversely the vikings with their purple people eaters defense were the only other team to appear in multiple super bowls iv viii ix and xi during the decade but failed to win each one 19811996 the nfc's winning streakedit in the 1980s and 1990s the tables turned for the afc as the nfc dominated the super bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s the nfc won 16 of the 20 super bowls during these two decades including 13 straight from super bowl xix to super bowl xxxi the 49ers against the dolphins in super bowl xix the most successful team of the 1980s was the 49ers which featured the west coast offense of hall of fame head coach bill walsh this offense was led by three-time super bowl mvp and hall of fame quarterback joe montana super bowl mvp and hall of fame wide receiver jerry rice running back roger craig and hall of fame defensive safetycornerback ronnie lott under their leadership the 49ers won four super bowls in the decade xvi xix xxiii and xxiv and made

conversely the cincinnati bengals xvi and xxiii dolphins xvii and xix and broncos xxi xxii and xxiv made multiple super bowls in the 1980s without winning one following several seasons with poor records in the 1980s the cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s during this decade the cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997 from 1992 to 1996 the cowboys won their division championship each year in this same period the buffalo bills reached the super bowl for a record four consecutive years but lost all four xxv-xxviii after super bowl

wide receiver michael irvin all three of these players went to the hall of fame the cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers who were the first team to win their league-leading fifth title overall with super bowl xxix with a dominant performance featuring the super bowl mvp and hall of fame quarterback steve young who threw a super bowl record 6 touchdown passes hall of fame wide receiver jerry rice and hall of fame cornerback deion sanders however the cowboys' victory in super bowl xxx the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with sanders after he won the super bowl

defending champion packers snapping the nfc's thirteen-year winning streak the following year the broncos defeated the atlanta falcons in super bowl xxxiii elway's fifth super bowl appearance his second nfl championship and his final nfl game the back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which afc teams would win nine out of 12 super bowls in the years between 1995 and 2018 five teamsthe steelers patriots broncos baltimore ravens and indianapolis coltsaccounted for 22 of the 24 afc super bowl appearances including the last 16 with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs in contrast the nfc saw a different representative in the super bowl every season from 2001 through 2010 the patriots playing against the eagles in super bowl xxxix the new england patriots became the dominant team throughout the early 2000s winning the championship three out of four years early in the decade they would become only the second team in the history of the

bowl xxxiv brady would go on to win the mvp award for this game the patriots also won super bowls xxxviii and xxxix defeating the carolina panthers and the philadelphia eagles respectively this

the departure of both its nfl teams in 1995 until the rams and the chargers subsequently returned to los angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively the caesars superdome in new orleans has hosted eight super bowls the most of any venue the orange bowl was the only afl stadium to host a super bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive super bowls hosting super bowls ii and iii seven super bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the nfl team in that city was using at the time a situation that has not arisen after super bowl xxvii's host stadium was selected on march 19 1991 this was as the winning market was previously not required to host the super bowl in the same stadium that its nfl team used if the stadium in which the super bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large high-profile event than the existing nfl home stadium in the same city for example five of los angeles's bowls were played at the rose bowl which has never been used by any nfl franchise outside of the super bowl besides the rose bowl the only other super bowl venues that were not the home stadium to nfl teams at the time were rice stadium the houston oilers had played in rice stadium previously but moved to the astrodome several years before super bowl viii and stanford stadium starting with the selection of the super bowl xxviii venue on may 23 1990 the league has given preference in awarding the super bowl to brand new or recently renovated nfl stadiums alongside a trend of teams demanding public money or relocating to play in new stadiums to date only two teams have qualified for a super bowl at their home stadiums the 2020 tampa bay buccaneers who won super bowl lv hosted at raymond james stadium selected on may 23 2017 and the 2021 los angeles rams

to reschedule the game in the event of heavy snowfall metlife stadium's selection over sun life stadium generated controversy as the league requested a roof to be added to sun life stadium a venue afflicted with a heavy rainstorm during super bowl xli in order to be considered for future super bowls which was done during a remodeling from 2015 into 2016 it then hosted super bowl liv there have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the super bowl from cities super bowl xxvii in 1993 was originally awarded to sun devil stadium in tempe arizona but after arizona voters elected not to recognize martin luther king jr day as a paid state employees' holiday in 1990 the nfl moved the game to the rose bowl in pasadena california when voters in arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992 super bowl xxx in 1996 was awarded to tempe super bowl xxxiii in 1999 was awarded first to candlestick park in san francisco but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through the

to qualcomm stadium in san diego super bowl xliv slated for february 2010 was withdrawn from new york city's proposed west side stadium because the city state and proposed tenants new york jets could not agree on funding super bowl xliv was then eventually awarded to sun life stadium in miami gardens florida super bowl xlix in 2015 was originally given to arrowhead stadium in kansas city missouri but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box a renovation proposal had passed successfully but a second ballot question to add a rolling roof structure to be shared with kaufmann stadium critical for the game to be hosted was rejected and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased kansas city eventually withdrew its request to host the game super bowl xlix was then eventually awarded to university of phoenix stadium in glendale arizona super bowl lv in 2021 was first awarded to the yet-to-be completed sofi stadium but construction delays forced the game to be moved to raymond james stadium and sofi stadium was then given super bowl lvi in 2022 super bowl lviii in 2024 was first given to the superdome but the nfl's 2021 regular season expansion pushed the

designationedit the designated home team alternates between the nfc team in odd-numbered games and the afc team in even-numbered games this alternation was initiated with the first super bowl when the packers were the designated home team regardless of being the home or away team of record each team has its team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones designated away teams have won 32 of 59 super bowls to date approximately 54 washington is one of six designated home teams that chose to wear the white jersey shown here in super bowl xvii since super bowl xiii in 1979 the home team is given the choice of wearing its colored or white jerseys originally the designated home team had to wear its colored jerseys which resulted in the cowboys donning their less exposeddiscuss dark blue jerseys for super bowl v while most of the home teams in the super bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys there have been seven exceptions the cowboys during super bowls xiii and xxvii the washington redskins during super bowl xvii the steelers during super bowl xl the broncos during super bowl 50 the patriots in super bowl lii and the buccaneers in super bowl lv the cowboys since 1964 have worn white jerseys at home the washington redskins wore white at home under coach joe gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992 continued by richie petitbon and norv turner through 2000 then again when gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007 meanwhile the steelers who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the aflnfl merger in 1970 opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road wearing white the steelers' decision was compared with the patriots in super bowl xx the patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season but after

denver general manager john elway simply stated we've had super bowl success in our white uniforms they previously had been 04 in super bowls when wearing their orange jerseys the broncos' decision is

unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms nfl super bowl and super bowl sunday as a result many events and promotions tied to the game but not sanctioned by the nfl are asked to refer to it as the big game or other generic descriptions a radio spot for planters nuts parodied this by saying it would be super to have a bowl of planters nuts while watching the big game and comedian stephen colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the superb owl in 2015 the nfl filed opposition with the uspto trademark trial and appeal board to a trademark application submitted by an arizona-based nonprofit for superb owl another entity has a service mark for superb owl the nfl claims that the use of the phrase super bowl implies an nfl affiliation and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly for example the league says super bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that promote a message while non-sporting event venues are also prohibited to show the super bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches some critics say the nfl is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that any use is prohibited as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the united states legislation was proposed by utah senator orrin hatch in 2008 to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games and for other purposes in 2004 the nfl started issuing cease-and-desist letters to casinos in las vegas that were hosting super bowl parties super bowl is a registered trademark owned by the nfl and any other business using that name for profit-making ventures is in violation of federal law according to the letters in reaction to the letters many las vegas resorts rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties started referring to them as big game parties in 2006 the nfl made an attempt to trademark the big game as well however it withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and public relations opposition to the move mostly from stanford university and the university of california berkeley and their fans as the stanford cardinal football and california golden bears football teams compete in the big game which has been played since 1892 28 years before the formation of the nfl and 75 years before

declared tax-free in madhya pradesh and goa reception critical response prasanna zore of rediff gave the film 4 out of 5 writing chhaava deserves 2 stars for the historically half-baked film that it is but 4 stars just for its attempt on making a film on chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj zee news gave 4 stars out of 5 stars and wrote chhaava is much more than just an action-packed period drama it's a film that resonates with its historical significance while maintaining its emotional core pooja biraia jaiswal of the week rated 35 stars out of 5 stars and wrote the film showcases regality and grandeur adrenaline-pumping action sequences and punchy dialogues but interestingly it does all of that and more while ensuring it doesn't lose track of the plot and the narrative that runs beautifully across all its frames nishad thaivalappil of news18 gave 35 out of 5 rating and the reviewer highlights vicky kaushal's outstanding portrayal of chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj and praises the film for effectively capturing his legacy kusumika das of times now awarded 35 stars out of 5 stars and wrote while utekars storytelling could have been tighter his attempt is commendable most notably chhaava unveils a fierce unrelenting vicky kaushal in a historical saga renuka vyavahare of the times of india have 35 stars out of 5 stars and wrote chhaavas excellence lies in its gripping second half and a terrific climax devesh sharma of filmfare rated 35 stars out of 5 stars and noted that chhaava succeeds in delivering a high-intensity action film anchored by vicky kaushal's powerhouse performance however he pointed out that the film doesn't fully delve into the complexities of sambhaji's character leaving much of his multifaceted legacy unexplored shubhra gupta of the

commented that unlike its protagonist who often runs into battle like a man possessed even when the odds seem stacked against him the film simply wasnt brave enough to take that leap tushar joshi of india today wrote chhaava doesn't aim to be exceptionally different but it masters the art of navigating the mainstream waters without completely drowning in the cacophony of its own voice rahul desai of the hollywood reporter india observe that chhaava is neither romanticised nor pulpy its just scared so scared that only gods and demons can afford to exist so scared that its blinded by its own reflection anuj kumar of the hindu said that struggling to choose between history and the current nationalist sentiment laxman utekars unsurprising narrative finds its voice in the final nandini ramnath of scrollin said in her review that laxman utekar takes us through every bit of this ordeal its what chhaava has been building up to the christ-like imagery is apposite given the all-round love for medieval punishment but the films lack of feeling is vivid too with shouty speechifying mistaken for heartfelt passion and sumptuous visuals confused for grandeur box office chhaava had a

classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through third grade or in any manner deemed to be against state standards in all grades she said the bill bans government and government schools from indoctrinating woke sexual values in our schools to a captive audience she also suggested that the bill should apply to all grades foreign policy positions see also political positions of tulsi gabbard against islamism and interventionism in her foreign policy positions gabbard has taken a strong stand against islamist movements in the middle east and advocated tougher actions against islamist militant organizations such as al qaeda and the islamic state during her interview with the west hawaii today newspaper in 2016 gabbard described herself as a hawk when it comes to the war against terrorists but a dove when it comes to counterproductive wars of regime change gabbard has also called for reducing military interventionism by the united states she criticizes the neocon war machine and media giants ruled by corporate interests who are in the pocket of the establishment war machine for us involvement in counterproductive wasteful regime change wars stating they have not made the united states any safer and have contributed to a new cold war and nuclear arms race middle east israel and palestine after hamas' october 7 2023 attack on israel gabbard came out strongly in support of israel and condemned hamas calling it an islamist terrorist organization in november 2023 she attended the march for israel at the national mall in washington dc she has called pro-palestine protesters in the us puppets of a radical islamist organization gabbard is opposed to a ceasefire in gaza in an interview uploaded to youtube in february she called hamas a threat that needs to be defeated militarily and ideologically when asked what she thought about the us supporting a un resolution that seeks a ceasefire in gaza gabbard said it needs to be approached strategically we have to be realists about the threat that continues to exist for the people of israel so as long as hamas is in power the people of israel will not be secure and cannot live in peace islamist militancy al-qaeda isis egypt's sisi iran gabbard at the tomb of the unknown soldier at arlington national cemetery in virginia during her time in us congress gabbard took strong stances in opposition to islamist political movements and organizations in the middle east in some of her appearances on fox news between 2013 and 2017 she faulted president obama over his refusal to refer to the islamic state's beliefs and terrorism as islamic extremism or radical islam in a 2015 interview with cnn's wolf blitzer gabbard criticized the obama administration for refusing to say that the real enemy of the united states is islamic extremists gabbard expressed reservations about the us involvement in syrian civil war and said that we must end our war to overthrow the syrian government and focus our attention on defeating al-qaeda and isis in 2015 gabbard met with egyptian dictator 'abd al-fattah al-sisi in cairo after the meeting she issued a statement expressing her commendation of sisi as a ruler who showed great courage and leadership in his regime's war against islamist ideology her close engagement with sisi an arab autocrat responsible for the killing of more than 800 people in the rabaa massacre was met with widespread criticism journalist evan hill summarized gabbard's foreign policy as rooted in authoritarianism cloaked as counter-terrorism nationalism cloaked as anti-interventionism and an open espousal of islamophobia on december 20 2019 the stop arming terrorists act that she introduced in 2017 became law as part of national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2020 1228 to prohibit the department of defense from knowingly providing weapons or any other form of support to al qaeda or other terrorist groups or any individual or group affiliated with any such organization gabbard was critical of the us military's 2020 baghdad international airport airstrike which targeted and killed high-level iranian general qasem soleimani as an act of war by us president donald trump and a violation of the us constitution arguing that trump did not have congressional authorization for this act the assad regime in syria controversial visit to syria 2017 in january 2017 gabbard went on a one-week fact-finding mission to syria and lebanon during which she met various political and religious leaders from both countries and also had two unplanned meetings with then-syrian-president bashar al-assad the visit was arranged by two lebanese american men connected to the syrian social nationalist party the visit came after gabbard had introduced legislation that would in her words end our country's illegal war to overthrow the syrian government the visit was the first by a us lawmaker since nancy pelosi in 2007 and made under a travel warning issued by the united states department of state as required by house rules the house ethics committee approved the trip a state department official said that as the trip was private the department was not involved the trip was privately funded by a cleveland-based arab american group sympathetic to assad but after facing controversy over the trips funding gabbard decided to personally reimburse the cost of the trip as gabbard explained to cnn's jake tapper when the opportunity arose to meet with assad i did so because i felt it's important that if we profess to truly care about the syrian people about their suffering then we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there's a possibility that we could achieve peace and that's exactly what we've talked about regarding the rebel groups she remarked he strongest fighting force on the ground in syria is al-nusra or al qaeda and isis after her meeting with syrian religious leaders gabbard said that they called for an end to foreign support of terrorists who are trying to rid syria of its secular pluralistic free society however assad's regime was often ranked in the bottom on international freedom rankings gabbard's visit to assad was generally criticized by both sides of the political spectrum for giving assad credibility despite the civilian deaths under his regime a ron paul institute article thanked gabbard for seeing through the double-bind foreign policy trap of our bipartisan war policy opposition to us military intervention in syria following her 2017 visit to syria gabbard wrote there is no difference between moderate rebels and al-qaeda al-nusra or isis they are all the same this is a war between terrorists under the command of groups like isis and al-qaeda and the syrian government in 2018 gabbard characterized the us as waging a regime change war in syria since 2011 in a february 2019 interview with msnbc a month after the start of her presidential campaign she said assad is not the enemy of the united states because syria does not pose a direct threat to the united states in a subsequent interview on cnn she said there are brutal dictators in the world assad of syria is one of them that does not mean the united states should be waging regime-change wars around the world in august 2019 she said that assad is a brutal dictator just like saddam hussein just like gadhafi in libya the reason that i'm so outspoken on this issue of ending these wasteful regime-change wars is because i have seen firsthand this high human cost of war and the impact that it has on my fellow brothers and sisters in uniform skepticism on chemical weapons in april 2017 following the khan shaykhun chemical attack gabbard was interviewed by wolf blitzer on cnn she said that what matters is the evidence and facts stating she would denounce assad as a war criminal if found responsible by an independent investigation but expressed skepticism noting so whether the president says that they have the evidence the fact remains that they have not brought that evidence before congress and that the us military strike flew directly in the face of the un's action to launch an independent investigation she drew parallels to the iraq war warning against repeating a counterproductive regime war without clear evidence and congressional consent in a statement she said a successful prosecution of assad at the international criminal court will require collection of evidence from the scene of the incident and i support the united nation's efforts in this regard without such evidence a successful prosecution is impossible cnn headlined their report on the interview rep tulsi gabbard 'skeptical' that assad regime behind gas attack other outlets similarly reported gabbard's skepticism similar reporting reappeared in the run-up to and during her presidential campaign and again after her being nominated for dni politico in february 2019 and the bbc in november 2024 reported that she had called for evidence to be presented to congress on march 10 2019 in a cnn townhall in response to dana bash asking do you remain skeptical as you were in 2017 that bashir al assad used chemical warfare against syrian civilians gabbard said i want to correct that chemical weapons have been used in syria both by the syrian government as well as different terrorist groups she further clarified that her initial skepticism was specifically around incidents in 2017 which were used as an excuse to launch a us military attack in syria in august 2019 the tulsi 2020 presidential campaign published reports on chemical attacks in syria a short compilation of various analyses and reports mostly by scientist theodore postol on two attacks the document said that there is evidence that both sides have used chemical weapons in syria but that gabbard remained skeptical of the khan shaykhun chemical attack and the douma chemical attack with evidence they may have been staged by rebels and relaying a concern about an over-reliance on social media posts and unverified sources to support military actions according to investigative journalism group bellingcat gabbard's document presented a number of factual errors and misleading statements russian invasion of ukraine in 2019 gabbard affirmed on msnbc's morning joe that she views putin as a us adversary on february 11 2022 during the build-up to russia's invasion of ukraine gabbard suggested president biden could end this crisis and prevent a war with russia by guaranteeing ukraine will not become a member of nato and that he should do this since it is highly unlikely ukraine will ever become a member she expressed skepticism about the motives behind not resolving the issue blaming warmongers on both sides in washington and suggesting the us might want russia to invade in order to impose draconian sanctions and cement a new cold war she criticized this as benefiting the military-industrial complex that controls so many of our politicians at the expense of american ukrainian and russian citizens on february 13 gabbard said it is not in our national security interests for ukraine to become a member of nato anyway so why not give russia that assurance on february 23 the day russia invaded ukraine gabbard repeated her point that this war and suffering could have easily been avoided if biden adminnato had simply acknowledged russia's legitimate security concerns after the invasion on february 27 gabbard advocated for a peaceful resolution through neutrality stating it's time to put geopolitics aside and embrace the spirit of aloha respect and love for the ukrainian people by coming to an agreement that ukraine will be a neutral country here would be no russian or nato troops on each other's non-baltic borders this would allow the ukrainian people to live in peace on april 4 2022 gabbard tweeted president putin not only is your brutal attack on ukraine reprehensible it has been a huge geopolitical error which has already cost russia dearly t is the best interest for the russian people and the people of ukraine that you pull your forces out now some lawmakers have accused gabbard of taking foreign policy positions they saw as sympathetic to russia and these positions have often resulted in praise from russian media however in 2024 the new york times noted that no evidence has emerged for a connection between gabbard to any russian agencies although her advocacy for improving us diplomatic ties has made her a popular voice in russian state media controversy about us biological research in ukraine see also ukraine bioweapons conspiracy theory on march 9 2022 tucker carlson after airing a video of the state department's victoria nuland saying e are now quite concerned russian troops may be seeking to gain control of ukraine's biological research facilities so we are working with the ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of russian forces asked gabbard how concerned are you that there are unsecured bio agents dangerous bio agents in ukraine gabbard responded i'm extremely concerned the seriousness of this situation really can't be overstated we have these pathogens in the midst of a war zone in between 20 and 30 labs in ukraine this is a global crisis on march 13 on twitter she reiterated the urgency stating that these us-funded labs could easily be compromised and called for the biden-harris administration to work with russia ukraine nato the un to immediately implement a ceasefire in the vicinity of these labs until they're secured and these pathogens are destroyed later that day forbes reported tulsi gabbard shared false information sunday about us involvement in ukraine biological laboratories here's no evidence of the us supporting biological labs in ukraine and the us has consistently denied doing so shortly thereafter mitt romney tweeted tulsi gabbard is parroting false russian propaganda her treasonous lies may well cost lives rep adam kinzinger accused gabbard of spreading actual russian propaganda traitorous in response to carlson asking what her response would be to romney gabbard said this is about facts they're accusing me of saying that somehow there are bioweapons labs in ukraine i've said no such thing at any point i have said that there are biolabs in ukraine that have received us support that contained dangerous pathogens that if those labs are breached this is a dangerous crisis that needs to be addressed immediately the second thing they're saying is they deny these biolabs are even there when officials from our own government department of state department of defense and so on are saying these biolabs in ukraine have dangerous pathogens and we're very concerned that they may be breached that same day gabbard tweeted to romney asking him to provide evidence that what i said is untrue and treasonous evidence of the existence of such biolabs their vulnerability and thus the need to take immediate action to secure them is beyond dispute citing senate testimony by victoria nuland a pentagon fact sheet cbs face the nation a cnn fact-check and the us embassy in ukraine which acknowledged there are us funded labs in ukraine working with pathogens bioweapons being produced in ukraine has been debunked as disinformation by multiple media outlets scientific groups and international bodies on march 14 whoopi goldberg on the view accused gabbard of spreading false russian propaganda that same day newsweek noted that gabbard had asserted accurately that the us funds bio labs in ukraine not bio weapons labs but that a number of people had criticized gabbard for in their view appearing to echo falsehoods being peddled by russia newsweek also noted her appearance on carlson's show had been shown on russian media that evening gabbard tweeted she was not convinced there are biological weapons bioweapons in ukraine but she was concerned about existence of biological labs in a warzone noting she had said two days prior that the biolabs in ukraine if breached would release spread deadly pathogens to usworld she also noted that 'iolabs' 'bioweapons labs' and 'bioweapons' are 3 very different things but because these phrases are so similar there is sometimes miscommunication and misunderstanding when discussing them and so used the tweet to clarify the distinctions among the terms on march 15 newsweek reported that gabbard had clarified her comments about biolabs newsweek also misquoted her as having said in her march 9 tucker carlson show appearance that she was 'deeply concerned' over claims about biological weapons in ukraine whereas what she had told carlson was that she was extremely concerned about dangerous bio agents philip bump of the washington post accused gabbard of falsely claiming the us was trying to cover this up and generating attention and engagement while she is amplifying this negative and misleading assertion about the us government on august 30 2024 dana milbank wrote in a washington post op-ed gabbard endorsed russian propaganda in falsely claiming the united states was funding biological laboratories in ukraine that could spread dangerous pathogens after trump nominated gabbard for dni on november 13 2024 several news organizations reported that in 2022 gabbard had accused the us of running bioweapons laboratories in ukraine several others said she had clarified or walked back her remarks ap reported gabbard had endorsed moscow's claim that ukraine was using the labs to create deadly bioweapons abc reported gabbard had expressed concerns that ukraine was in possession of biological weapons and that she had posted a video about us-funded biolabs that 'could easily be compromised' a debunked theory the washington post said gabbard had come under scrutiny for propagating the false claim of alleged presence of 25 or more us-funded biolabs in ukraine with the potential to spread deadly pathogens two days prior to gabbard's hearing before the ssic us news world report said gabbard initially endorsed the russian theory that us-funded laboratories were working on deadly viruses that could be used as bioweapons the day prior to the hearing ap said gabbard had echoed similar russian conspiracy theories and the independent said she appeared to fall for conspiracy theories promoted by russia and later walked back those remarks on february 11 2025 during senate consideration of the nomination of gabbard for dni senator jack reed said as mitt romney tweeted on march 13 2022 she made bogus claims about a us funded covert biological weapons program in ukraine tulsi gabbard is parroting false russian propaganda her treasonous lies may well cost lives east asia during her 2020 presidential campaign gabbard criticized president donald trump's confrontational attitude towards china instead proposing a cooperative relationship to confront global challenges such as climate change she opposed trump's trade war with china calling his approach extremely volatile and having ravaging and devastating effects on both manufacturers and farmers while expressing concern the trade war could eventually lead to a hot war with china she also stated her belief that the trade war has made it more difficult to secure chinese support over a nuclear deal with north korea she said america should work with china on denuclearization of the korean peninsula in december 2023 gabbard said that as we remember japan's aggression in the pacific we need to ask ourselves this question is the remilitarization of japan which is presently underway truly a good idea we need to be careful that shortsighted self-serving leaders do not end up bringing us again face-to-face with a remilitarized japan azerbaijan and armenia gabbard has often expressed her support for the armenian christian population in the conflict with azerbaijan in 2017 gabbard was part of a team of us lawmakers that visited armenia including the disputed breakaway region of nagorno-karabakh which is also claimed by azerbaijan she was thus blacklisted by azerbaijan later she accused turkey of encouraging and inciting 2020 nagorno-karabakh conflict between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh and co-signed a letter to secretary of state mike pompeo expressing concern over azerbaijan's renewed aggression against artsakh nagorno karabakh and possible conflict with armenia gabbard stated that the united states must urge azerbaijan to immediately end their attacks and turkey to cease its involvement both directly and indirectly in 2019 gabbard was a co-sponsor of the armenian genocide resolution legislation along with several other us senators and us representatives to lock in official us recognition and permanent remembrance of the armenian genocide while talking about the 1915 mass killings gabbard said the ottoman empire was attempting to cleanse itself of the armenian and christian populations and the us

league nfl as a member of the national football conference nfc east division the team plays its home games at lincoln financial field in the south philadelphia sports complex the franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt frankford yellow jackets when a group led by bert bell secured the rights to an nfl franchise in philadelphia since their formation the eagles have appeared in the playoffs 31 times won 16 division titles including 13 in the nfc east appeared in four pre-merger nfl championship games winning three of them 1948 1949 and 1960 and appeared in five super bowls winning super bowls lii and lix the philadelphia eagles rank among the best teams in the nfl for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season the eagles are owned by jeffrey lurie who bought the team in 1994 for 185 million in december 2024 the eagles became one of the first teams in the nfl to sell an ownership stake to outside investors the deal sold 8 of the franchise at a valuation of 83 billion history main article history of the philadelphia eagles nfl in philadelphia 18991931 main article frankford yellow jackets the frankford athletic association was organized in may 1899 in the parlor of the suburban club the cost of purchasing a share in the association was 10 however there were also contributing memberships ranging from 1 to 250 made available to the general public the association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses in keeping with its charter which stated that all profits shall be donated to charity all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions the original frankford athletic association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together and they became known as loyola athletic club in keeping with yellow jackets tradition they carried the frankford name again in 1912 to become the frankford athletic association in the early 1920s the frankford athletic association's yellow jackets gained a reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation in 1922 frankford absorbed the philadelphia city champion team the union quakers of philadelphia that year frankford captured the unofficial championship of philadelphia during the 1922 and 1923 seasons the yellow jackets compiled a 621 record against teams from the national football league this led to the association being granted an nfl franchise in 1924 thus becoming the frankford yellow jackets in spite of winning the nfl championship in 1926 midway through the 1931 season the yellow jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations bell and wray era 19331940 see also bert bell and lud wray shibe park the eagles' home field which they shared with baseball's phillies in 1940 and then from 1942 to 1957 philadelphia municipal stadium the eagles' home field from 1936 to 1939 and again in 1941 after more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement for the yellow jackets in the lucrative philadelphia market the national football league granted an expansion franchise to an ownership group headed by bert bell and lud wray who were also awarded the liquidated assets of the defunct yellow jackets organization the bellwray group had to pay an entry fee of 3500 or roughly us67000 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars and assumed a total debt of 11000 the yellow jackets owed to three other nfl franchises drawing inspiration from the blue eagle logo of the national recovery administration a centerpiece of president franklin d roosevelt's new deal policies bell and wray named their new franchise the philadelphia eagles while it could seem as if the yellow jackets simply rebranded as the eagles both the eagles organization and the nfl officially regard the teams as two separate entities not only was there no philadelphia nfl team for a season and a half but almost no players from the 1931 yellow jackets appeared on the eagles' first roster in the 1933 nfl season the eagles were one of three teams along with the pittsburgh pirates now the pittsburgh steelers and the now-defunct cincinnati reds to join the nfl as expansion teams wray became the eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by bell his former teammate at penn the eagles originally intended to play their home games at shibe park which was the home of the philadelphia athletics professional baseball in philadelphia when negotiations for the use of shibe park fell through however the eagles struck a deal with the athletics' crosstown rival the philadelphia phillies to begin playing at the baker bowl the eagles played their first game on october 15 1933 against the new york giants at the polo grounds in new york city and lost the game 560 the eagles struggled over the course of their first decade never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons their best finish was in 1934 the second season for the eagles when they tied for third in the east the eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former penn temple and villanova players who played for the eagles for a few years before going on to other things in 1935 bell proposed an annual college draft to equalize talent across the league the draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings a practice still followed today strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent between 1927 when the nfl changed from a sprawling midwestern-based association to a narrower major-market league and 1934 three teams the chicago bears new york giants and green bay packers won all but one title with the exception of the providence steam roller which won in 1928 by 1936 the eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction bert bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the

became the eagles' starter for the 1961 season they finished a half-game behind the new york giants for first place in the eastern conference standings with a 104 record despite the on-the-field success however the franchise was in turmoil the 1962 team decimated by injury managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 490 loss to the packers the off-field chaos continued through 1963 as the 65 shareholders remaining from the original happy hundred sold the team to jerry wolman a 36-year-old millionaire washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team paying an unprecedented 5505 million for control of the club in 1964 wolman hired former cardinals and washington redskins coach joe kuharich to a 15-year contract over the next five seasons the team failed to

kuharich after a disappointing 24411 record during his five-year reign tose then named former eagles wide receiver pete retzlaff as the team's general manager and jerry williams as its new head coach with the merger of the nfl and afl in 1970 the eagles were placed in the nfc east division with the new york giants washington redskins and dallas cowboys the eagles' heated rivalry with the giants is the oldest of the nfc east rivalries dating back to 1933 and is often cited as one of the best rivalries in the nfl 1970 was also the last season for the eagles at franklin field the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3101 in 1971 the eagles moved to veterans stadium which had just been constructed and was initially acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering after a 3101 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to cincinnati dallas and san francisco to open the 1971 season williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach ed khayat a defensive lineman on the eagles' 1960 nfl championship team williams and khayat were hampered by retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback norm snead to the minnesota vikings in early 1971 leaving the eagles a choice between journeyman pete liske and raw rick arrington khayat lost his first two games but won six of the season's last nine thanks largely to the efforts of the eagles' defense led by all-pro safety bill bradley who led the nfl in interceptions 11 and interception return yardage 248 the team regressed in 1972 to finish 2111 and khayat was released the two wins both on the road proved to be surprises however philadelphia beat the kansas city chiefs which had had the best record in the afc a year before 2120 and the houston oilers 1817 on six field goals by kicker tom dempsey the latter game had been called the johnny rodgers bowl because the loser in finishing last in the league would gain the first overall pick in the 1973 nfl draft which was then presumed to be nebraska wingback johnny rodgers the heisman trophy winner with their loss the oilers got first pick and took university of tampa defensive end john matuszak who later faced philadelphia in super bowl xv with the second overall pick the eagles selected usc tight end charle young khayat was replaced by offensive guru mike mccormack for the 1973 season aided by the skills of quarterback roman gabriel and towering young wide receiver harold carmichael they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense new general manager jim murray also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line most notably through the addition of future pro bowl linebacker bill bergey in 1974 overall however the team was still mired in mediocrity mccormack was

115 record as montgomery shattered team rushing records with a total of 1512 yards in 1980 the team dominated the nfc facing its chief nemesis the dallas cowboys in the nfc championship game the game was played in cold conditions before faithful fans at veterans stadium led by an outstanding rushing performance by montgomery whose long cutback td run in the first half is one of the most memorable in eagles history and a gutsy game from fullback leroy harris who scored the eagles' only other td that day the birds earned a berth in super bowl xv with a 207 victory the eagles traveled to new orleans for super bowl xv where they were heavily favored over the oakland raiders who had squeaked into the playoffs as a wild-card team things did not go the eagles' way beginning with tose's imprudent decision to bring comedian don rickles into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood jaworski's first pass was intercepted by rod martin setting up an oakland touchdown later in the first quarter a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to rodney parker was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty the final score was 2710 journeyman quarterback jim plunkett was named the game's mvp the team got off to a promising start in the 1981 season by winning their first six games they ended up 106 to earn a wild-card berth however their hopes to repeat as nfc champs were dashed in the wild-card round by the new york giants who won 2721 after the eagles finished 36 in the strike-shortened 1982 season vermeil quit the team citing burnout defensive coordinator marion campbell replaced

players including ron jaworski randall cunningham took his place and despite a 5101 season began showing considerable promise 1987 saw another strike which shortened the season by one game the substitutes who had filled in for the strikers performed poorly and were crushed 4122 by the dallas cowboys after the strike the regular eagles' 1987 team won a 3720 revenge game against dallas the season record was 78 of which three games had been played by substitutes the eagles reached the playoffs in 1988 but lost to the chicago bears the team that ryan had helped lead to a super bowl xx victory as defensive coordinator the game became known as the fog bowl due to the inclement weather during the game the eagles lost 2012 the following two years would see playoff appearances as well but the team never made it past the first round this failure was very frustrating to eagles fans as the team was widely regarded as among the most talented in the nfl on offense the eagles were led by quarterback cunningham one of the most exciting players of his generation tight end keith jackson and running back keith byars the defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history and as the best to never win a championship the two 1989 matches with dallas were known as the bounty bowls both were won easily by the eagles the cowboys finished 115 that year and were

successfully lured 49ers star ricky watters to join the team as a free agent in 1995 rhodes's first season the eagles got off to a slow start by losing three of their first four games but subsequently rebounded to finish with a 106 record and a playoff spot in the wild card round the eagles playing at home overwhelmed the detroit lions 5837 with 31 of philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter however the eagles were again eliminated in the next round by the cowboys by a score of 3011 this would be randall cunningham's last game as an eagle cunningham scored the only touchdown of the game and the last eagles postseason touchdown for six years 1995 marked the end of cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback rhodes benched cunningham in favor of rodney peete leading to friction between the two earlier rumors had circulated that lurie and rhodes had tried to trade cunningham to the arizona cardinals however no such trade materialized and cunningham retired shortly after the season in 1996 the eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic kelly green to a darker midnight green the team got off to a good start winning three of their first four games however a week 5 monday night game at veterans stadium against the rival cowboys witnessed a season-ending knee injury to peete loss of the team's momentum and the transition to an offense led by ty detmer and watters while detmer played well and watters rushed for 1411 yards the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern 106 record and early elimination a 140 shutout by the 49ers in

defensive tackle from 2012 to 2023 the eagles reemerged as a predominant nfl team under the leadership of new head coach andy reid who was hired away from the green bay packers where he was the packers' quarterback coach reid's first notable step was drafting syracuse quarterback donovan mcnabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 nfl draft the eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the eagles to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted cleveland browns despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as ricky watters and irving fryar reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among philadelphia fans the drafting of mcnabb was unpopular with many eagles fans many of whom traveled to madison square garden for the 1999 draft and booed the selection believing the eagles instead should have selected ricky williams a university of texas running back who had been named the 1998 ap college player of the year the 1999 season was largely a rebuilding year for the eagles the team which routinely sells out its home games in philadelphia had two 1999 home games that failed to sell out resulting in local tv blackouts another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game the week 5 home game at veterans stadium on october 10 1999 against the dallas cowboys represented the last play of cowboys wide receiver michael irvin's career in the game irvin was driven into the turf by eagles safety tim hauck which left irvin lying motionless some eagles fans responded with applause giving further rise to philadelphia's reputation as unduly aggressive and hostile fans irvin was transported from the field by stretcher and then by ambulance to thomas jefferson university hospital irvin who was diagnosed with a potentially threatening cervical spine injury and forced to announce his nfl retirement after the injury later said the philadelphia fans were applauding his departure rather than his serious injury the team finished the season with a record of 511 the 2000 regular-season opener in dallas on september 3 became known in nfl lore as the pickle juice game kickoff temperature in texas stadium was 109 degrees fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120 making it the hottest game in league history beating a previous record set in a 1997 cowboyscardinals match in arizona the nickname came about because an eagles trainer had prepared for the predicted heat by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion the experiment proved successful as the eagles won 4114 while multiple cowboys players had been consigned to the bench unable to handle the torrid climate while the eagles had no players benched the game was also significant as marking the beginning of philadelphia's domination of the nfc east the team finished the season at 115 reaching the playoffs as a wild card which restored fan optimism after brushing aside the tampa bay buccaneers 213 the eagles moved to the second round of the playoffs only to lose 2010 to the new york giants after compiling an 115 record in 2001 the eagles reached the playoffs again this time at the top of their division in a near rerun of the previous year they disposed of the buccaneers in a 319 game in the second round the eagles defeated the bears 3319 at soldier field in the nfc championship game they were unable to stop the st louis rams who defeated them 2924 despite injuries mcnabb led the eagles to a 124 season in 2002 once again they reached the nfc championship game but lost at home 2710 to the eventual super bowl champion tampa bay buccaneers in the last game at veterans stadium in the opening game of the 2003 season the eagles were shut out 170 by the tampa bay buccaneers in the first regular-season game ever played at their new home lincoln financial field once again the team went 124 for the season and then reached the conference championship game in doing so the eagles became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game they achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown receptions all year by their wide receivers which tied the league-low since the regular-season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 this record would be broken in 2004 when the new york giants' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes the eagle receivers went through both september and october without a td catch the last time an nfl team had done that was in 1945 in the divisional round of the playoffs the eagles beat the green bay packers 2017 in overtime thanks in part to a late-game completion from mcnabb to freddie mitchell on an iconic play that has come to be known as 4th and 26 they lost the nfc championship game to the carolina panthers 143 panthers cornerback ricky manning jr had three interceptions in the game the eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver terrell owens and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the baltimore ravens and the san francisco 49ers on march 16 2004 the 2004 season began with a bang as owens caught three touchdown passes from mcnabb in their season opener against the new york giants owens ended up with exactly 1200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury in a december 19 game against the dallas cowboys the eagles' 127 victory in this game gave them home-field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row the eagles tied a record by clinching the nfc east division crown their fourth straight after only their eleventh game of the season matching the mark set by the 1985 chicago bears and the 1997 san francisco 49ers their final two regular-season games thus rendered meaningless the eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost both yet still finished the season with a 133 record mcnabb had his best season to date passing for 3875 yards and 31 touchdowns with only eight interceptions this made him the first quarterback in nfl history to throw 30 or more td passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season they then began their playoff run with the divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded minnesota vikings the eagles led from the start and never looked back as mcnabb led a very efficient passing attack 21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 tds brian westbrook dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards and freddie mitchell performed very well on the receiving corps 5 receptions for 65 yards and a td as philadelphia won 2714 setting up their fourth-straight nfc championship appearance facing the atlanta falcons mcnabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns while also rushing for 32 yards westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39 winning the

black stripe to one stripe of black another of silver with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants the 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys with a green instead of black shadow on white numbers and silver trim these black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season usually the first home game after a bye week and the season finale

seasons the eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams the team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004 although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s to celebrate the team's 75th anniversary the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder in addition the team wore throwback jerseys in a 2007 game against the detroit lions the yellow and blue jerseys the same colors found on philadelphia's city flag are based on those worn by the philadelphia eagles in the team's inaugural season and had been the same colors used by the frankford yellow jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931 the eagles beat detroit 5621 in the 2010 season against the green bay packers on september 12 2010 the eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team in weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season the eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the washington redskins and atlanta falcons respectively before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games for the 2012 season nike took over from reebok as the nfl's official apparel licensee but the eagles decided that they would not be adopting nike's elite 51 uniform technology aside from the nike logo replacing the reebok logo the only other change is the league-wide revision of the nfl shield on the uniform replacing the nfl equipment logo other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged the eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season for the 2014 season the eagles officially adopted the elite 51-style uniform from nike however they only wore the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green in week 6 of 2014 against the new york giants the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys giving them a blackout uniform set the eagles won the game 270 the victory was their first shutout in 18 years in week 16 of 2016 also against the giants the eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the nfl color rush program but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look with the exception of 2017 the eagles have regularly worn the all-black uniforms at home against the giants since the 2014 'blackout' game the black jerseyswhite pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the new england patriots after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants in 2018 the eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys in week 6 of the 2017 season the eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the carolina panthers the all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the nfl's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look during week 10 of the 2021 season the eagles paired their white uniforms with the alternate black pants against the denver broncos marking the first time the black pants were paired with a different colored uniform in 2022 the eagles unveiled a new black alternate helmet which would be worn alongside the all-black uniform in addition the team announced that throwback kelly green uniforms would return as an alternate uniform starting in the 2023 season the team originally intended to release the uniforms in 2022 but due to production supply issues the eagles elected to delay its release to the 2023 season the eagles returned to wearing kelly green uniforms as the teams alternate with their debut being in a week 7 win vs the miami dolphins with the kelly green helmet becoming the team's one alternate the black helmet was temporarily shelved and the eagles returned to wearing their primary midnight green helmets with the all-black uniform back in 2022 it was released to the media that the eagles would be changing their wordmark to a more modernized design due to supply chain issues the new wordmark was not able to be applied to the uniforms until the 2024 season in addition the black helmet was brought back as the team's third helmet option while the nfl only allowed teams with new designs to adopt a third helmet in 2024 the eagles' minor change of jersey wordmark counted as such the black helmets were worn with the white jerseys black pants and white

is inevitable signifying their displeasure with the given team's performance and that they are instead putting their hope into the eagles occasionally travelling phillies fans may even chant this when the phillies appear to be a few innings away from an inevitable win on the road as a way to celebrate their team and philadelphia as a whole the eagles and phillies were both the main tenants at veterans stadium before lincoln financial field and citizens bank park were built notable famous fans of the eagles include actors bradley cooper rob mcelhenney and miles teller actor and comedian

at the stadium 20 suspects came before him that day fan behavior improved after the team's move to lincoln financial field and eagles court ended in december 2003 during a january 2025 home playoff
