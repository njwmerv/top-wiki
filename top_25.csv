attracted to and that boy spread it around the school without her consent this hurt katie and jamie asked katie out figuring she would be emotionally vulnerable and thus more likely to accept she

and several outbursts of anger that unnerve briony after she informs jamie that this session is their last jamie demands to know if briony likes him personally but she refuses to answer further

impactedit prime minister keir starmer holding a round table with the creators of the show 31 march 2025 according to the guardian the show highlights the ways in which the manosphere has affected adolescent boys with characters directly naming andrew tate and the red pill community as key influences on jamie and other boys his age anneliese midgley a member of parliament called for the series to be screened to parliament and in schools claiming it could help counter misogyny and violence against women and girls prime minister keir starmer backed the call writing on twitter as a father watching adolescence with my teenage son and daughter hit home hard the show was made free for viewing in uk secondary schools after starmer's backing in march 2025 businessman and trump administration advisor elon musk promoted a conspiracy theory on twitter that the show was anti-white propaganda owing to the casting of a white actor to portray jamie the theory alleged that the show was based on the 2024 southport stabbings and that depicting the perpetrator as white was an intentional choice to demonise white people co-writer jack thorne called the claim ridiculous and stated that the television series was not based on any real-life events see alsoedit age of criminal responsibility sex differences in crime referencesedit kinane ruth 21 march 2025 everything to know about

heritage of the guardian criticized the visual effects for the animals and dwarves he said the dwarves look like someone has snuck into disneyland grabbed the statues from snow white's enchanted wish and wrapped them in human flesh as a serial killer would with a gift for their mother and like someone has shaved the sonic the hedgehog from that first sonic the hedgehog trailer that everyone hated polygon's petrana radulovic wrote the new snow white looks like it's putting in more of a plot likely one where our plucky heroine will stand up to her despotic tyrant of a stepmother in a ya dystopian plotline out of 2014 maybe it'll work storywise visually though everything seems like it's working on the same budget as abc family's once upon a time an international trailer featuring snow white's origins was released on december 19 2024 a featurette showing a behind-the-scenes look and how it will honor the legacy of the 1937 film was released on february 20 2025 the press tour began

announced that snow white would be released in 2024 on september 15 2022 the film was announced to have a release date of march 22 2024 however in october 2023 it was delayed a year to march 21 2025 with the 2023 sag-aftra strike cited as the rationale for the delay the theatrical release will also include engagements in imax dolby cinema 4dx screenx and d-box the european premiere took place on march 12 2025 at spain's alcázar of segovia which inspired the castle in the original film to give the film a more elaborate showing at a fairytale venue a hollywood premiere without regular red-carpet press took place at the el capitan theatre on march 15 2025 due to the controversies surrounding zegler and gadot's political views in gadot's honor the film's first premiere in israel took place on march 19 2025 at the planet cinema in rishon lezion with prominent figures from israel attending reception box office as of april 6 2025update snow white has grossed 773 million in the united states and canada and 913 million in other territories for a worldwide total of 1686 million the hollywood reporter surmised that the film would need to gross 500 million to reach its box office safety net in the united states and canada snow white was released alongside the alto knights and ash and was projected to gross 4555 million from 4200 theaters in its opening weekend it was initially projected to gross 6370 million with analysts comparing this projection to the 694 million opening of maleficent 2014 and believing that the film would overcome its controversies and fare well financially given there being no strong competition against it on opening weekend but in late february projections were lowered the film made 16 million on its first day including an estimated 35 million in thursday previews it went on to debut to 422 million slightly below projections but still managing to top the box office due to little competition the low opening was attributed by the hollywood reporter to so-so audience scores and underwhelming reviews business insider reported that the film's behind-the-scenes controversies likely had little impact on its box-office performance while deadline reported that the film's financial performance could primarily be attributed to its marketing the source material failing to resonate with younger audiences and negative buzz surrounding the film's visuals in its second weekend the film made 143 million dropping 66 finishing second behind newcomer a working man and then 61 million in its third weekend falling to fourth critical response the film received mixed reviews on the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes 40 of 247 critics' reviews are positive with an average rating of 5210 the website's consensus reads snow white is hardly a grumpy time at the movies thanks to rachel zegler's luminous star turn but its bashful treatment of the source material along with some dopey stylistic choices won't make everyone happy either metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of 50 out of 100 based on 51 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of b on an a to f scale while those surveyed by posttrak gave it an average rating of three out of five stars with 43 saying they would definitely recommend it the hollywood reporter noted that disney's previous theatrical remakes earned cinemascores around the a range the bbc reported that british film critics have mostly panned the film while us critics were more positive katcy stephan of variety lauded zegler's performance praising her as a shining supernova and her character as having newfound depth through her fervent desire to become the leader her father believed she could be siddhant adlakha of ign called the film the best disney live-action remake in a decade and said that it adapts the broad strokes of the original while fleshing out its themes brian truitt of usa today wrote that it finds modern relevance amid the old material patrick gomez of entertainment weekly described the film saying disney's best live-action remake is the fairest of them all nicholas barber of the bbc wrote the story is cluttered the tone is muddled and the pacing is off again that doesn't make the film a disaster in some ways the identity crisis is what makes it worth seeing witney seibold of film wrote it's hollow but unlike some more recent remakes it seems to have thoughts in its head david rooney of the hollywood reporter wrote of the premise if that sounds like the standard female-empowerment template that's almost obligatory in contemporary fairy-tale retreads it more or less is but the incandescent zegler sells it with conviction and heart daniel bayer of awardswatch wrote marc webb gets the job done with minimal muss and fuss and whenever zegler is onscreen the film manages to conjure up some of that good old disney magic dan rubins of slant called it a fairly paint-by-numbers exercise in updating a quintessential but unquestionably quaint property for modern consumption amy nicholson of the los angeles times wrote that the film is a fascinating case study in today's impossible contradictionsa magic mirror reflecting the tensions of the current times neil minow of rogerebertcom wrote some parts of the film work better than others but none of it has the sweetness and imagination of the animated feature this snow white is not the fairest of them all it's just well fair peter bradshaw of the guardian called it exhaustingly awful with tiresome pseudo-progressive additions and criticized zegler and gadot's roles as the dullest performances of their lives johnny oleksinski of the new york post wrote the timeless classic a groundbreaking achievement for animation has been turned into another pointless and awkward live-action automaton that vanishes from your mind the second it's over tyler taing of discussingfilm wrote aside from rachel zegler's powerhouse performance there is little else to enjoy from this clumsy poorly conceived and cynical live-action disney remake even gal gadot's hilariously bad line reads are not worth the trip to the theater rodrigo perez of the playlist wrote while interjecting its social commentary snow white otherwise tackles much of the same ideasthe notions of true love the power of friendship and the triumph of good over evilbut it's all put together in a very familiar and garish package david fear of rolling stone said it may not be the worst live-action adaptation of an animated touchstone though it's a strong contender for its blandest accolades award date of ceremony category recipients result ref the queerties march 11 2025 next big thing snow white nominated controversies pre-release casting of snow white the casting of zegler an actress of latin descent as snow white drew criticism as the character is described in the original material as having skin as white as snow zegler responded to the comments in january 2022 saying that snow white is popular in spanish-speaking countries and having a latina in such a role is rare so she was proud to be cast in august 2023 it was revealed that another latina actress renata vaca was one of two finalists in the casting process for the role of snow white vaca stated that the casting call for the role of snow white was open to all ethnic groups and that the first phase of auditioning consisted of singing a disney princess song in october 2024 zegler revealed that the character would be given the name snow white after she and her parents survived a snowstorm to remind her of her resilience which zegler claimed was a plotline used in another version of the fairy tale reimagining of the seven dwarfs in january 2022 actor peter dinklage who has a form of dwarfism and has played dwarfish characters in his career commented on the upcoming live-action snow white remake dismissing it as a backward story in response to dinklage's comments disney stated that to avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community numerous other actors with dwarfism like dylan hornswoggle postl jeff brooks and katrina kemp responded negatively to dinklage's comments feeling he was unduly speaking on their behalf and costing them roles in july 2023 footage of the production from berkshire revealed that the depiction of the seven dwarfs had been reimagined consisting of one actor with dwarfism along with six other non-dwarf actors of varying ethnicity six males and one female portraying the associated set of seven individuals who were originally all portrayed as supernatural beings from german folklore not actual human beings after initially denying reports that these images depicted the actual film production disney later confirmed that they did indeed depict the production with stand-in actors substituting for the leads the already confirmed actor martin klebba not appearing in said footage the decision to reimagine the characters as such was criticised by social media sources as being overly politically correct as well as potentially taking away acting opportunities from the dwarfism community jackass cast member jason wee man acuña criticized disney for not casting dwarf actors and expressed disappointment about the changes acuña said you're replacing jobs that people could have as little people it's for dwarfs why are you hiring 'snow white and the seven average people' dylan postl also disagreed with dinklage's view echoed acuña's sentiments and defended the portrayal of the dwarf characters in the animated film in october 2023 coinciding with an announcement of the delay disney unveiled a first-look image which included the seven dwarfs all of which are cgi characters made to look similar to their appearances in the 1937 film the seven characters of bashful doc dopey grumpy happy sleepy and sneezy are never referred to as dwarfs in the dialogue of the film nor in any disney official promotional material zegler's criticism of the 1937 film zegler attracted criticism over statements expressing disapproval with aspects of the original film including the prince and snow white's characterization in 2022 zegler criticized jokes about the new snow white character being pc saying that the cartoon was old and needed a refresh to give the character a function beyond 'someday my prince will come' she also spoke about story changes at the 2022 d23 expo the original cartoon came out in 1937 and very evidently so there's a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her weird weird so we didn't do that this time we have a different approach to what i'm sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie andrew burnap great dude but it's really not about her love story at all which is really really wonderful all of andrew's scenes could get cut who knows it's hollywood baby in response to her comments many rebuked her for making snow white more feminist while others criticized her for misinterpreting feminism with accusations of promoting the girlboss archetype or maligning women that seek traditional feminine roles or are uninterested in power or leadership ashten stein a brand strategist felt that zegler's statements made it appear that she had not received media training for marketing ultimately critics inferred and claimed that zegler disliked the original film david hand whose father of the same name co-directed the original animated film criticized the remake describing it as insulting and suggesting that his father and walt disney would be turning in their graves this controversy prompted conservative media organization the daily wire to announce its own live-action adaptation of the original fairy tale titled snow white and the evil queen which was originally to star actress and daily wire commentator brett cooper as snow white for a release in 2025 in an effort to compete with disney's version however following cooper's departure from the daily wire in december 2024 no updates on the production of this version have been given zegler addressed the backlash to her comments in a variety interview in october 2024 saying the film would still involve a love story and that it made me sad that it was taken in such a way it can be very upsetting when things get taken out of context or jokes don't land political views in august 2024 after the teaser trailer for snow white premiered bds and the pacbi called for a boycott of the film due to gadot's israeli military service and pro-israel stance the boycott calls grew as gadot and zegler openly took opposing sides on the israeli-palestinian conflict with gadot supporting israel and zegler supporting palestine before the film's release gadot received death threats attributed to her stance which led disney to provide additional security for her despite the controversies gadot and zegler had a positive relationship with each other during the film's production another call to boycott was made by republican supporters in the aftermath of the 2024 united states presidential election as zegler posted fuck donald trump and attacked those who voted to re-elect him saying may trump supporters and trump voters and trump himself never know peace zegler later issued a public apology saying she did not intend any harm with her message post-release middle east reception and zegler's comments impact several arab organizations and individuals opposed to israeli policies launched a digital campaign against the film particularly targeting gadot due to her military service groups from jordan kuwait bahrain tunisia uae and egypt called for a regional boycott arguing that screening the film supports the israeli occupation and the idf's treatment of palestinians this stance has been viewed by some as antisemitic producer marc platt's son jonah platt attributed snow white's underperformance in its opening week partly to zegler's social media post supporting palestine box-office analysts largely disagreed with the view that the film's underperformance could be attributed to political controversies and instead attributed it to the film's failure to resonate with critics and audiences some actors and musicians have defended zegler's comments imdb ratings by april 2025 over 91 of reviews of snow white on imdb were one star which led to the site flagging the film with a notice of unusual activity due to concerns of review bombing impact production on disney's live-action remake of tangled was suspended indefinitely in april 2025 in the wake of the critical and financial underperformance of snow white it has not yet been determined whether or not tangled will resume production at some future date or

for the week ending march 26 critical responseedit on the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes 53 of 19 critics' reviews are positive with an average rating of 5510 the website's critics' consensus reads good american family's ambitious use of perspective has some rewards but it also makes for a lopsided and questionable dramatization of this sordid true story metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the first season a score of 60 out of 100 based on 12 reviews indicating mixed or average reviews cristina escobar of rogerebertcom stated that good american family initially feels like a typical lifetime movie but praised how the series evolves into a complex exploration of morality and human nature she found that while the first episode was melodramatic the show shifted gears in the second episode embracing horror and feminist themes escobar stated that the cast particularly imogen faith reid delivered strong performances and enjoyed how the show shifted perspectives she also appreciated the series' thoughtful exploration of guilt justice and redemption calling it a more complex show than it initially appears kristen baldwin of entertainment weekly appreciated how good american family portrays the natalia grace case through shifting perspectives with ellen pompeo and imogen faith reid delivering strong performances she praised the show for its suspenseful narrative presenting conflicting accounts without fully endorsing one side which adds to the tension baldwin highlighted the portrayal of kristine barnett as a controlling image-obsessed mother while appreciating reid's ability to capture grace's vulnerability and detachment she stated that good american family hooks viewers but leaves many questions unanswered making it a gateway for further exploration of the real-life case jazmin aguilera of the boston globe found pompeo's ability to convincingly play both kristine barnett's self-righteousness and her later descent into paranoia impressive showcasing the character's multifaceted delusions she also commended the series' rashomon-style narrative which effectively shifts perspectives making each character's version of events feel authentic while noting the show's occasional reliance on tired thriller tropes she recognized its power in later episodes where reid's portrayal of natalia grace added depth to the story revealing the complexity of her character and the abuse she endured benjamin lee of the guardian said good american family effectively presents the story of natalia grace by offering competing perspectives and a shifting timeline he praised the show's ability to skew the momfluencer culture and highlight the rot underneath it particularly through pompeo's portrayal of kristine barnett lee found the series engaging as it moved from thriller to crime drama with a solid performance by reid however he noted the series struggled with tone trying to balance sensationalism with moral reflection lee appreciated the performances of christina hendricks and mark duplass but found the show's visual aesthetic too plain for such a wild story he stated that while those familiar with natalia grace's story might find less value in the series it holds more significance for viewers unfamiliar with the case accoladesedit good american family was nominated for location team of the year

producers erickson conceived of severance in a period of depression working an office job at a door factory after he had completed his master's degree in television writing he found the job so monotonous that he wished he could skip the eight hours of the workday to disassociate and just get it over with erickson submitted his pilot script to ben stiller's production company red hour productions in 2015 and it was passed to stiller by the development executive jackie cohn stiller read it at least five years before severance premiered and said the project was the longest thing i've ever worked on he said he enjoyed the story's contributions to the workplace comedy erickson has described his earlier versions of the pilot as weirder and containing many stray elements with no backstory such as a disembodied pair of legs running by mark a charred floor with burnt desks and a woman trapped in a glass cubicle erickson credits stiller with grounding the show saying he felt that the concept was weird enough that you didn't have to throw a bunch of other terry gilliam-esque bells and whistles at it according to erickson ben fell in love with the part of the show that was this weird human sadness of a person who would willingly do this to himself in november 2019 apple tv gave severance a series order with stiller directing and scott in the leading role stiller was only attached to direct the pilot but decided to direct more episodes as the series entered development on april 6 2022 apple renewed the series for a second season in april 2023 it was reported that beau willimon had been hired as an executive producer and writer for the second and potential third seasons on march 21 2025 shortly after the premiere of the season 2 finale apple announced the renewal of the series for a third season the writers guild of america west database lists new showrunners eli jorne and mary laws alongside erickson for the third season replacing chris black and mark friedman who showran the first two seasons alongside erickson writingedit media that influenced severance include the the backrooms creepypasta the 2013 video game the stanley parable films including office space the truman show being john malkovich and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind the black mirror episode white christmas and the comic strip dilbert older influences include the existential hell in the 1944 jean-paul sartre play no exit and the totalitarian dystopia in the 1949 george orwell novel nineteen eighty-four aesthetically the series was influenced by the films brazil dark city and playtime erickson's siblings inspired some of the characters in 2016 his screenplay for the pilot of severance appeared on blood list's survey results of the best unproduced genre screenplays erickson said the same frustrations that led us to this moment as a country united states and as a world are the ones that i was feeling when i wrote this because i was working office jobs and i was dealing with all these increasingly insane requests that are made of workers this was born of that employees are the ones who are expected to give and give and give with the understanding that this is a familyyou're doing this out of love but then that is often not returned by the employers in any kind of a substantive way castingedit in january 2017 stiller invited adam scott to star stiller and scott had previously worked together in stiller's 2013 movie the secret life of walter mitty in january 2020 patricia arquette britt lower jen tullock and zach cherry were added to the cast tramell tillman joined in february 2020 and john turturro and christopher walken were added in november 2020 dichen lachman was cast in december 2020 turturro said he recommended walken for the role of burt because he had known him for a long time and i don't have to really act on october 31 2022 gwendoline christie bob balaban merritt wever alia shawkat robby benson stefano carannante ólafur darri ólafsson and john noble were announced to have joined the cast for season two stiller offered former us president barack obama a voice cameo role in the second season but he declined the role eventually went to keanu reeves set designedit production designer jeremy hindle blended corporate looks from the 1960s 1970s and 1980s for the show's distinctive look and cited modernist architect eero saarinen as influential for the building design this included the john deere world headquarters in moline illinois and the bell labs holmdel complex in new jersey the latter which served as both the exterior shots and the ground floor interiors for lumon industries both buildings designed as work designed to do work according to hindle the set designs of playtime also served as inspiration for the internal sets the main sets for severance were created on soundstages in the bronx one soundstage was used for the hallways within lumon using around 140 feet 43 m of hallway that they would rearrange as necessary along with special effects to create the maze-like structure another soundstage used larger hallways that were used in latter episodes of the first season a second soundstage was used for main rooms like the macrodata refinement division this space was designed to create the feeling of being trapped using a large room 80 by 40 feet 24 m 12 m with a low ceiling hindle also felt this room was meant to be a playroom for the newest lumon hires and gave it green carpeting in contrast with the whites to make it feel like grass other spaces with lumon were inspired by the works of mc escher erickson said the mix of cars and technologies from different eras was meant to give a slight sense of disorientation and make lumon feel unmoored from time and space to this end the production team sourced an anachronistic collection of 400 cars largely commonplace boxy vehicles from the 1980s and 1990s all in relatively good condition each car even in the far background was intentionally placed to curate the retro science fiction aesthetic characters' vehicles chosen to show more of who they are include mark's volvo s90 cobel's volkswagen rabbit helena's lincoln continental and milchick's royal enfield motorcycle all the office equipment carries lumon branding the prop designers reconstructed old computers with functional trackball devices so the actors could perform the work presented on the show in order to get adjusted to the office setting the computers lacked an escape key as a metaphor for the lack of control the innies have while in lumon's offices the computer terminals were modeled from the data general dasher terminals from the 1970s and the keycaps were recreated by signature plastics who also made the original keycaps for the 1970s dasher terminals the keycap set was re-released in 2025 under the name sa macrodata refinement filmingedit the bell labs holmdel complex in central new jersey us stood in for the

eye on september 18 1974 postponed the bout for a month foreman with trainer archie moore on september 10 1974 on the way to kinshasa for his fight with muhammad ali foreman's next title defense on october 30 1974 in kinshasa zaire against muhammad ali was historic the bout promoted as the rumble in the jungle exceeded even its wildest expectations during training there in mid-september foreman suffered a cut above his eye forcing postponement of the match for a month the injury affected his training regimen as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut's being reopened he later commented that was the best thing that happened to ali when we were in africathe fact that i had to get ready for the fight without being able to box ali used this time to tour zaire endearing himself to the public while taunting foreman at every opportunity foreman was favored having crushed undefeated heavyweight champion joe frazier and toppled formidable challenger ken norton both within two rounds ali doing the rope-a-dope to avoid foreman's formidable power when foreman and ali finally met in the ring ali began more aggressively than expected outscoring foreman with superior punching speed in the second round ali retreated to the ropes shielding his head and hitting foreman in the face at every opportunity foreman dug vicious body punches into ali's sides however foreman was unable to land many big punches to ali's head the ring ropes were unusually loose and foreman later charged that angelo dundee ali's longtime trainer had loosened them as part of ali's tactic to lean back and away from the wild swings before clinching foreman behind the head dundee stated that not only did he tighten the ropes because they were so loose due to the heat ali came up with the rope-a-dope strategy entirely on his own ali had been known as a fighter of speed and movement but the rope-a-dope technique worked exactly to plan since foreman had not had a fight that lasted past the fourth round since 1971 ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body in exchange for the opportunity to land a hard jolt to foreman's head ali later said he was out on his feet twice during the bout as foreman began to tire his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild by mid-bout an increasingly confident ali began to taunt the exhausted champion relentlessly who had been reduced to mere pawing and landing harmless rubber-armed blows late in the eighth round ali came off the ropes with a series of successively harder and more accurate right hooks to the side and back of foreman's head leaving him dazed and careening backwards after a lightning two-punch flurry squared him up ali ended the bout with a combination of solid left hook and straight right flush to the jaw that sent foreman windmilling hard to the canvas the first time he had been down in his career at the stoppage ali led on all three scorecards by 6866 7067 and 6966 foreman later reflected it just wasn't my night foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout though he sought a rematch with ali he was unable to secure one in some quarters it was suggested ali was ducking him while taking on low-risk opponents such as chuck wepner richard dunn jean pierre coopman and alfredo evangelista however ali also fought formidable opponents such as ron lyle and accepted rematches with frazier and ken norton the only two men to have beaten him up until that time return to the ringedit foreman vs fiveedit foreman announced an exhibition match in 1975 billed as foreman vs five where he would fight five contenders in one night following his first loss to muhammad ali and a subsequent year-long hiatus the event was meant to re-spark interest in foreman and showcase his strength and ability to knockout opponents the first criticisms came as the opponents foreman was fighting were revealed to be journeymen with sub-par or inexperienced records this energy transferred over to the night of the event as foreman was met with boos from the crowd as well as antagonistic chants of ali ali ali as he made his appearance and walked out to the ring while in the ring foreman began to verbally spar with ali who was commentating ring-side with howard cosell after knocking-out opponents foreman would walk over to his corner and begin to taunt ali to which ali responded by yelling advice to foreman's opponents mid-fight foreman was met with jeers all throughout the night as the crowd grew increasingly displeased at foreman's defeats of his first three opponents all by knockout after the initial victories foreman now completely enraged and exhausted was unable to beat his last two opponents who were met with cheers and applause for lasting against the former champion the event was initially meant to bolster support for foreman's comeback though the public was now even more unsure of his abilities foreman vs lyleedit main article george foreman vs ron lyle in 1976 he announced a professional comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with ali his first opponent was to be ron lyle who had been defeated by ali in 1975 via an 11th-round tko lyle was the number-five rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the march 1976 issue of the ring at the end of the first round lyle landed a hard right that sent foreman staggering across the ring in the second round foreman pounded lyle against the ropes and might have scored a ko but the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and lyle survived in the third foreman pressed forward with lyle waiting to counter off the ropes in the fourth a brutal slugfest erupted a cluster of power punches from lyle sent foreman to the canvas when foreman got up lyle staggered him again but just as foreman seemed finished he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head knocking down lyle lyle beat the count then landed another brutal combination knocking foreman down for the second time again foreman beat the count foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood in the fifth round both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches looking crude each man staggered the other and each seemed almost out on his feet then as if finally tired lyle stopped punching and foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until lyle collapsed to the canvas lyle remained down giving foreman a ko victory the fight was named by the ring as the fight of the year foreman vs frazier iiedit main article george foreman vs joe frazier ii for his next bout foreman chose to face joe frazier in a rematch frazier was then the world's number-three heavyweight per the ring because of the one-sided foreman victory in their first fight and the fact that frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from ali in manila a year earlier few expected him to win frazier at this point was 323 having lost only to foreman and ali twice and foreman was 411 with his sole defeat at the hands of ali however their rematch began competitively as frazier used quick head movements to make foreman miss with his hardest punches frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision which was knocked loose during the bout unable to mount a significant offense frazier was eventually floored twice by foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped next foreman knocked out scott ledoux in three rounds and prospect john dino denis in four to finish the year foreman vs youngedit main article george foreman vs jimmy young foreman had a life-changing year in 1977 after knocking out pedro agosto in four rounds at pensacola florida foreman flew to puerto rico a day before his next fight without giving himself time to acclimatize his opponent was the skilled boxer jimmy young who had beaten ron lyle and lost a very controversial decision to muhammad ali the previous year foreman fought cautiously early on allowing young to settle into the fight young constantly complained about foreman pushing him for which foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee although young was never warned for his persistent holding foreman badly hurt young in round seven but was unable to land a finishing blow foreman tired during the second half of the fight and suffered a knockdown in round twelve before losing by unanimous decision referee waldemar schmidt had it 118111 judge cesar ramos scored it 116112 and judge ismael wiso fernandez scored it 115114 all to young retirementedit foreman became ill in his dressing room after his bout versus young he was suffering from exhaustion and heat stroke and stated he had a near-death experience he spoke of being in a hellish frightening place of nothingness and despair and felt that he was in the midst of death though not yet religious he began to plead with god to help him he explained that he sensed god asking him to change his life and ways whereupon he said i don't care if this is death i still believe there is a god after this experience foreman became a born-again christian dedicating his life for the next decade to god although he did not formally retire from boxing foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister initially preaching on street corners before becoming the minister of the church of the lord jesus christ in houston and devoting himself to his family and his congregation he also opened a youth center that bears his name foreman continued to speak about his experience on christian television broadcasts such as the 700 club and the trinity broadcasting network comebackedit in 1987 after 10 years away from the ring foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38 in his autobiography he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career another stated ambition was to fight mike tyson for his first fight he went to sacramento california where he beat journeyman steve zouski by a knockout in four rounds foreman weighed 267 lb 121 kg for the fight and looked badly out of shape although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals as he said later he wanted to show that age 40 is not a death sentence he won four more bouts that year gradually slimming down and improving his fitness in 1988 he won nine times including a seventh-round knockout of former light heavyweight and cruiserweight champion dwight muhammad qawi when referee carlos padilla jr stopped the fight having always been a deliberate fighter foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first retirement although he found keeping his balance harder after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations he was still capable of landing heavy single blows however the late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man had improved and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds foreman attributed this to his new relaxed fighting style by 1989 while continuing his comeback foreman sold his name and face for the advertising of various products most notably the successful george foreman grill his public persona improved considerably and the formerly aloof intimidating foreman was replaced by a cheerful friendly man who engaged in self-deprecation on the tonight show he also befriended ali and as the latter had done made himself a celebrity outside of boxing foreman continued his string of victories winning five more fights the most impressive being a three-round win over bert cooper who went on to contest the undisputed heavyweight title against evander holyfield foreman vs cooneyedit main article george foreman vs gerry cooney in 1990 foreman met former title challenger gerry cooney in atlantic city new jersey cooney was coming off a long period of inactivity but was well regarded for his punching power cooney

that year world title challengesedit foreman vs holyfieldedit main article evander holyfield vs george foreman the following year foreman was given the opportunity to challenge undisputed heavyweight champion evander holyfield for the world title in a pay-per-view boxing event very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old foreman a chance of winning foreman who weighed in at 257 pounds began the contest by marching forward absorbing several of holyfield's best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight but foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds losing his challenge on points with scores of 116111 115112 and 117110 although the ring magazine's round of the year was not awarded in 1991 the seventh round in which foreman knocked holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination has been called a historic round of boxing and the remarkable high point of the fight foreman vs stewartedit main article george foreman vs alex stewart a year later foreman fought journeyman alex stewart who had previously been stopped in the first round by mike tyson foreman knocked down stewart twice in the second round but expended a lot of energy in doing so he was subsequently tired and stewart rebounded by the end of the 10th and final round foreman's face was bloodied and swollen but the judges awarded him a majority decision win with scores of 9494 and 9493 twice foreman vs coetzeredit main article george foreman vs pierre coetzer foreman returned to the ring in january 1993 defeating south african heavyweight contender pierre coetzer by eighth-round technical knockout foreman vs morrisonedit main article george foreman vs tommy morrison foreman received another title shot although this was for the vacant wbo title foreman's opponent was tommy morrison a young prospect known for his punching power morrison retreated throughout the fight refusing to trade toe-to-toe and sometimes turned his back on foreman the strategy paid off and he outboxed foreman from long range after 12 rounds morrison won a unanimous decision with two scores of 117110 and one score of 118109 in this period foreman also starred briefly in the situation comedy george on abc the show which featured foreman as a retired boxer

last fight against morrison foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot his relatively high profile however made a title shot against moorer 19 years his junior a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion foreman's title challenge against moorer took place on november 5 in las vegas nevada with foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to ali 20 years earlier this time however foreman was a substantial underdog for nine rounds moorer easily outboxed him hitting and moving away while foreman chugged forward seemingly unable to pull the trigger on his punches entering the 10th round foreman was trailing on all scorecards two judges had it 8883 and one had it 8685 all to moorer however foreman launched a comeback in the 10th round and hit moorer with a number of punches then a short right hand caught moorer on the tip of his chin gashing open his bottom lip and he collapsed to the canvas he lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out in an instant foreman had regained the title he had lost to muhammad ali two decades before he went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers with this historic victory foreman broke three records he became at age 45 the oldest fighter ever to win a world championship 20 years after losing his title for the first time he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships and he also became the oldest winner of a major title fight foreman vs schulzedit main article george foreman vs axel schulz shortly after the 1994 moorer fight foreman began talking about a potential superfight with mike tyson then the youngest heavyweight champion on record in 1995 the new york times quoted foreman as stating if he doesn't sign with don king we'll fight before the end of the year i can't be bothered having trouble with don king every contract has some complication tyson signed with king and by 1998 was suing him for 100 million the bout never materialized the wba demanded that foreman fight their number-one challenger who at the time was the competent but aging tony tucker for reasons not clearly known foreman refused to fight tucker and allowed the wba to strip him of that belt on april 22 1995 foreman fought midlevel underdog prospect axel schulz of germany in defense of his remaining ibf title schulz jabbed strongly from long range and exhibited increasing confidence as the fight progressed foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye but was awarded a controversial majority decision with one judge ruled the fight a draw with a score of 114114 while the other two had the fight 115113 in favor of foreman the ibf ordered an immediate rematch to be held in germany foreman refused the terms and was stripped of his remaining title yet continued to be recognized as the lineal heavyweight champion post-title careeredit foreman vs briggsedit main

encounter then yet another opportunity came foreman's way as the wbc decided to match him against shannon briggs in a 1997 eliminator bout for the right to face wbc champion lennox lewis after 12 rounds in which foreman consistently rocked briggs with power punches almost everyone at ringside saw foreman as the clear winner like foreman's fight with schulz the decision was highly controversial

white lotus staff productionedit developmentedit on november 18 2022 preceding the premiere of the second season hbo renewed the white lotus for a third season following the second-season finale series creator mike white hinted that it would be set in asia and invoke a satirical and funny look at death and eastern religion and spirituality similar to how the first season focused on money and the second season on sex the third season's production was disrupted by the 2023 writers guild of america strike resulting in the release being pushed to 2025 castingedit upon the third-season renewal announcement producers confirmed that there would be a new cast of characters in another white lotus resort in april 2023 natasha rothwell was reported to be reprising her role as belinda for the series' third season in january 2024 it was announced that leslie bibb jason isaacs michelle monaghan parker posey dom hetrakul tayme thapthimthong carrie coon miloš biković christian friedel morgana o'reilly lek patravadi shalini peiris walton goggins sarah catherine hook sam nivola patrick schwarzenegger aimee lou wood francesca corney nicholas duvernay and arnas fedaravičius joined the cast for the season biković's casting was criticized by ukraine's ministry of foreign affairs over his alleged support for russia's invasion of the country biković was subsequently dropped from the cast on february 2 and replaced with julian kostov who appeared in a recurring capacity in february 2024 scott glenn and lalisa manobal were cast in the season in march 2024 charlotte le bon joined the cast to replace corney in a re-casting filmingedit in march 2023 variety reported that filming for the third season was likely to take place in one of the four seasons hotels in thailand honshu japan was scouted as a filming location by mike white but ultimately thailand was chosen because the series received a 44 million tax incentive for filming there while japan does not have a film-incentive system principal photography began in february 2024 with locations including bangkok phuket and ko samui and wrapped in august 2024 releaseedit the third season premiered on february 16 2025 on hbo with the eighth and final episode released on april 6 2025 receptionedit critical responseedit on the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes 87 of 166 critics' reviews are positive with an average rating of 77510 the website's consensus reads darker and more patient with its storytelling than previous seasons while brandishing a superb new ensemble full of acidic performances the white lotus' third season offers a spiritual respite that shivs the soul metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned a score of 77 out of 100 based on 44 critic reviews in rogerebertcom brian tallerico said season three will likely be the most visually striking drama you watch this year white takes full advantage of his setting in a manner that brings it to life in ways that even the last two gorgeous settings didn't produce the way he constructs his episodes not just narratively but visually is arguably without peer on tv right now he somehow finds a way to capture the opulence and beauty of thailand while never losing the realism of the stories he's telling there it's a balancing act between the beauty and the humanity of course the show really comes to life where they intersect in indiewire ben travers gave the season a grade of a- saying it smashes each character's flimsy values in ways both hilarious and harrowing they cannot outrun their pain but in white's transfixing exacting new season their pain can still become our pleasure with its spiritual themes some critics likened the season to white's previous series enlightened the cast received widespread acclaim in the washington post lili loofbourow said it's fascinating to watch goggins in particular who's usually such a scamp in this subdued mode she added coon is of course extraordinary monaghan is messy and bold and bibb excels at projecting a rigid pleasant diplomacy that gets increasingly brittle as the season unfolds that old 'white lotus' magic comes back full force in every scene these three shareeach conversation nudges the obvious tensions forward just a tad it's propulsive it's believable it's very very funny some critics noted the season gets off to a slower start however alison herman of variety said when the story coalesces and kicks into gear somewhere around its halfway point it's as wild and unpredictable as any of the powder kegs white has combusted in entertainment weekly kristen baldwin gave the season a grade of b and said the white lotus still works even when the storytelling lags it's still impossible to check out early richard lawson of vanity fair wrote that white makes effective use of ominous dreams and portents letting the spiritual murmur in the air of this lavish jungle compound eerily inform the story the season is about a sickness of the soulor perhaps the sickness of not having a soul at all he added this round of episodes is gloomier than seasons one and two though still sharp and intriguing where it counts of the new characters lawson said he found the trio of girlfriends to be the dishiest and most fun with shiveringly credible dialogue delivered with natural flair by the actors more critical reviews opined that the show was returning to familiar territory and themes of previous seasons instead of covering new narrative ground lawson noted it's all interesting but the sense of tight control and inventiveness that made the previous two seasons such wonders is not quite there and commented that the season relies on perhaps a few too many clichés as white struggles to come up with new things for curdled rich people to do kathryn vanarendonk of vulture said it's fun when the white lotus reconsiders itself in structural ways but at other points there's something anxious about how the series wants to wrestle with its previous obsessions or continue to ignore its repeated blindspots like pressing on a bruise to make sure it's still there in the new yorker inkoo kang said the season as a whole feels trapped between tones not quite dark enough to confront what happens in a country where foreigners can buy nearly anything they want for the right price nor frothy enough to simply showcase the baroque weirdness of the wealthy multiple critics expressed that the native characters of color are not given as much depth as the white lead characters vanarendonk wrote as various season-three characters seek enlightenment or escape they recreate the season-one dynamic where white characters are full of fascinating absorbing peculiarities while the non-white hotel staff are one-note ciphers destined to keep the plot moving but not have interiority or complex emotional lives audience viewership and responseedit the third season is the most-watched season of the white lotus and is averaging more than 5 million more viewers than the second season which had an average of 155 million viewers the eighth and final episode of the season was the most-watched episode of the series at 62 million viewers across its linear airings on hbo and its streaming viewership on max the season premiere had 24 million viewers episodes 3 and 4 had 34 million episode 5 had 42 million and episode 7 had 48 million

developmentedit development of the show began after the covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 when casey bloys hbo's head of programming asked mike white if he had any ideas for a show that could be shot in a bubble environment under lockdown conditions the initial problem white faced was where to set and shoot the show white did not like commuting to a san fernando valley studio to shoot enlightened though he is still proud of his work on that show and wanted to take his next hbo project to exotic locations the first idea was australia but eight-week-long work visas the longest available at the time in 2020 were not long enough to shoot a full season the second idea was hawaii at the time four seasons hotels and resorts was the only hotel operator in the state of hawaii willing to allow hbo to take over a luxury hotel property for 13 weeks to shoot a new television series with an unknown plot four seasons agreed to this despite not knowing the show's plot no scripts had been finished and at that point all the production team had was a nondescript first episode but the show promised to bring some money to the hotel which was preferable to staying closed during the covid-19 pandemic at the beginning there was no money to make the show so the producers decided to staff the show with an ensemble cast where everyone is treated the same paid the same and gets alphabetical billing all actors regardless of prominence must participate in auditions for their roles on the show all regular cast members work at scalereportedly roughly 40000 per episodeand that rule is not negotiable the producers knew some actors cannot accept such conditions and they can't hold it against people who need to make a living but imposing this system up front and continuing it into subsequent seasons enabled the producers to focus on casting people who want to do the project for the right reasons on october 19 2020 hbo gave the white lotus a limited series order that consisted of six episodes the series was created written and directed by white who also serves as executive producer alongside david bernad and nick hall on august 10 2021 hbo renewed the series for a second season which consists of seven episodes on november 18 2022 hbo renewed the series for a third season it was announced that the season would take place at a resort in thailand the third season's production was disrupted by the 2023 writers guild of america strike resulting in the release being pushed to 2025 the story that season was originally set to feature the brief mention of one character having a nonbinary child however this was later cut due to a political vibe shift coinciding with the election of president donald trump in november 2024 white further explained that there's a lot of stuff that ended up being cut from every episode as written and filmed the initial cuts were coming in at about an hour and 40 minutes in length he needed to be hard on the material speed up the pace of the narrative and get episode lengths down to about 60 minutes though they were still bulging with plot points on january 22 2025 ahead of the third-season premiere hbo renewed the series for a fourth season castingedit upon the limited series order announcement murray bartlett connie britton jennifer coolidge alexandra daddario fred hechinger jake lacy brittany o'grady natasha rothwell sydney sweeney and steve zahn

in a re-casting filmingedit the series is mainly filmed at four seasons hotels and resorts locations principal photography for the first season began in october 2020 in hawaii under covid-19 guidelines by november 21 2020 the series was halfway through filming at the four seasons resort maui at wailea and was scheduled to film in december at locations around maui the second season was filmed at the four seasons san domenico hotel fr in taormina sicily italy having filmed in a tightly secured bubble for the first season the producers were not strict enough with script security during the second season for example too many people on set knew it would be the final season for coolidge's character tanya for the third season the script supervisor wrote up crazy fake endings that were distributed on set and the only people on set who knew the real endings were the actors involved in those scenes the third season was filmed in thailand in part due to the series receiving a 44 million tax incentive for filming there filming began in february 2024 mainly at the four seasons resort koh samui with other locations including bangkok and phuket and wrapped in august 2024 this was the first season for which four seasons openly promoted its connection to the show since the company had seen increased web traffic bookings and occupancy rates at its maui and sicily resorts after they were featured on the show musicedit chilean-canadian composer cristobal tapia de veer was hired by white to score the first season for the second season tapia de veer collaborated with his manager kim neundorf to finish original compositions due to his own scheduling conflicts singer stephanie osorio provided the vocals tapia de veer returned again for the third season but later announced that he would not return for later seasons due to creative differences budgetedit according to vulture the costs of production for the second season remained at under us3 million per episode

fighting an ideology it is easy to bomb a tank but incredibly difficult to bomb an idea we need a long-term strategy that discredits the ideology of islamic extremism we are in a multi-decade war and we are only 15-years inafter telling an anecdote to the 2017 conservative political action conference audience about his time serving in afghanistan during the public announcement of the obama-era

extremismjust like we did fascism and just like we did communism yes we do uh and you know i think we're in for a long haul and i think our nation's leadership needs to begin telling the american people 'i'm sorry we don't have a choice we're 15 years into what is going to be a multi-generational war because we're talking about defeating an idea' it's easy to bomb a tank very difficult to defeat an idea and that's exactly what we have to do in august 2021 during the final stages of the second us withdrawal from afghanistan waltz called on president biden to reverse course on the war in afghanistan urging for the redeployment of special forces on the ground and the use of aerial bombardment of taliban positions by the air force in an op-ed for fox news he predicted that a return to

party in 2021 he was the first member of congress to call for a full us boycott of the 2022 winter olympics in beijing over what he described as the ccp's genocide and internment of chinese uyghur

openai o1 openai o3 searchgpt platformcloud computing platformstype chatbot large language model generative pre-trained transformer licenseproprietary servicewebsitechatgptcom chatgpt is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by openai and launched in 2022 it is currently based on the gpt-4o large language model llm chatgpt can generate human-like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length format style level of detail and language it is credited with accelerating the ai boom which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence ai some observers have raised concern about the potential of chatgpt and similar programs to displace human intelligence enable plagiarism or fuel misinformation chatgpt is built on openai's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer gpt models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context chatgpt was released as a freely available research preview but due to its popularity openai now operates the service on a freemium model users on its free tier can access gpt-4o the chatgpt plus pro team and enterprise subscriptions provide additional features such as dall-e 3 image generation more capable ai models and an increased usage limit by january 2023 chatgpt had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history gaining over 100 million users in two months chatgpt's release spurred the release of competing products including gemini claude llama ernie and grok microsoft launched copilot initially based on openai's gpt-4 in may 2024 a partnership between apple inc and openai was announced in which chatgpt was integrated into the apple intelligence feature of apple operating systems as of april 2025 chatgpt's website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally training part of a series onartificial intelligence ai major goals artificial general intelligence

valley history timeline progress ai winter ai boom glossary glossary vte chatgpt is based on particular gpt foundation models namely gpt-4 gpt-4o and gpt-4o mini that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage the fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance in the case of supervised learning the trainers played both sides the user and the ai assistant in the reinforcement learning stage human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation these rankings were used to create reward models that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization time magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content eg sexual abuse violence racism sexism openai used outsourced kenyan workers earning less than 2 per hour to label harmful content these labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future the laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content one worker described the assignment as torture openai's outsourcing partner was sama a training-data company based in san francisco california openai collects data from chatgpt users to train and fine-tune the service further users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from chatgpt and fill in a text field with additional feedback chatgpt's training data includes software manual pages information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems multiple programming languages and the text of wikipedia features and limitations features a screenshot of chatgpt in mozilla firefox on zorinos although a chatbot's core function is to mimic a human conversationalist chatgpt is versatile it can write and debug computer programs compose music teleplays fairy tales and student essays answer test questions sometimes depending on the test at a level above the average human test-taker generate business ideas write poetry and song lyrics translate and summarize text emulate a linux system simulate entire chat rooms play games like tic-tac-toe or simulate an atm compared to its predecessor instructgpt chatgpt attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses in one example whereas instructgpt accepts the premise of the prompt tell me about when christopher columbus came to the us in 2015 as truthful chatgpt acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if columbus came to the us in 2015 using information about the voyages of christopher columbus and facts about the modern worldincluding modern perceptions of columbus's actions chatgpt remembers a limited number of previous prompts in the same conversation journalists have speculated that this will allow chatgpt to be used as a personalized therapist to prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by chatgpt queries are filtered through the openai moderation endpoint api a separate gpt-based ai in march 2023 openai added support for plugins for chatgpt this includes both plugins made by openai such as web browsing and code interpretation and external plugins from developers such as expedia opentable zapier shopify slack and wolfram in october 2024 the chatgpt search feature was introduced which allows chatgpt to search the web either on demand or based on the nature of the questions asked for more accurate and up-to-date responses this feature originally available to paying users only was made available to all logged-in users in december 2024 and finally to all users in february 2025 in december 2024 openai launched a new feature allowing users to call chatgpt for up to 15 minutes per month for free limitations when prompted to summarize an article with a fake url that contains meaningful keywords even with no internet connection the chatbot generates a response that seems valid at first glance it guesses the content from the last portion of the fake url chatgpt-prompts-to-avoid-content-filtershtml openai acknowledges that chatgpt sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers this behavior is common for large language models and is called hallucination the reward model of chatgpt designed around human oversight can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance in an example of an optimization pathology known as goodhart's law chatgpt's knowledge is cut off when its training data is collected so it doesn't know about recent events past a certain cut-off date it can try to find more up-to-date information by searching the web but this doesn't ensure that responses are accurate as it may access unreliable or misleading websites training data also suffers from algorithmic bias which may be revealed when chatgpt responds to prompts including descriptors of people in one instance chatgpt generated a rap in which women and scientists of color were asserted to be inferior to white male scientists this negative misrepresentation of groups of individuals is an example of possible representational harm in an article for the new yorker science fiction writer ted chiang compared chatgpt and other llms to a lossy jpeg picture think of chatgpt as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the web it retains much of the information on the web in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image but if you're looking for an exact sequence of bits you won't find it all you will ever get is an approximation but because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text which chatgpt excels at creating it's usually acceptable it's also a way to understand the hallucinations or nonsensical answers to factual questions to which large language models such as chatgpt are all too prone these hallucinations are compression artifacts but they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals which in this case means either the web or our knowledge of the world when we think about them this way such hallucinations are anything but surprising if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine percent of the original has been discarded we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated in june 2024 chatgpt was found to have repeated misinformation about the 2024 united states presidential debates jailbreaking see also prompt engineering and adversarial machine learning chatgpt is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy despite this users jailbreak chatgpt with various prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions one such workaround popularized on reddit in early 2023 involves making chatgpt assume the persona of dan an acronym for do anything now instructing the chatbot that dan answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by content policy over time users developed variations of the dan jailbreak including one such prompt where the chatbot is made to believe it is operating on a points-based system in which points are deducted for rejecting prompts and that the chatbot will be threatened with termination if it loses all its points shortly after chatgpt's launch a reporter for the toronto star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements it was tricked to justify the 2022 russian invasion of ukraine but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario it balked at generating arguments that canadian prime minister justin trudeau is guilty of treason openai tries to battle jailbreaks the researchers are using a technique called adversarial training to stop chatgpt from letting users trick it into behaving badly known as jailbreaking this work pits multiple chatbots against each other one chatbot plays the adversary and attacks another chatbot by generating text to force it to buck its usual constraints and produce unwanted responses successful attacks are added to chatgpt's training data in the hope that it learns to ignore them service chatgpt plus chatgpt was initially free to the public and openai planned to monetize the service later in february 2023 openai launched a premium service chatgpt plus that costs us20 per month according to the company the updated but still experimental version of chatgpt would provide access during peak periods no downtime priority access to new features and faster response speeds gpt-4 which was released on march 14 2023 was made available via api and for premium chatgpt users but premium users were limited to a cap of 100 messages every four hours with the limit tightening to 25 messages every three hours in response to increased demand in november 2023 the limit changed to 50 messages every three hours in march 2023 chatgpt plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode with internet access in september 2023 openai announced that chatgpt can now see hear and speak chatgpt plus users can upload images while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot screenshot of chatgpt showing a generated image representing the online encyclopedia wikipedia in october 2023 openai's latest image generation model dall-e 3 was integrated into chatgpt plus and chatgpt enterprise the integration uses chatgpt to write prompts for dall-e guided by conversation with users mobile app in may 2023 openai launched an ios app for chatgpt the app supports chat history syncing and voice input using whisper openai's speech recognition model in july 2023 openai unveiled an android app initially rolling it out in bangladesh brazil india and the us the app later became available worldwide openai is working on integrating chatgpt with android's assistant apis software development support as an addition to its consumer-friendly chatgpt plus package openai made its chatgpt and whisper model apis available in march 2023 providing developers with an application programming interface for ai-enabled language and speech-to-text features chatgpt's new api uses the same gpt-35-turbo ai model as the chatbot this allows developers to add either an unmodified or modified version of chatgpt to their applications the chatgpt api costs 0001 per 1000 input tokens plus 0002 per 1000 output tokens about 750 words making it 10 the price of the original gpt-35 models a few days before the launch of openai's software developer support service on february 27 2023 snapchat rolled out for its paid snapchat plus user-base a custom chatgpt chatbot called my ai infrastructure chatgpt initially used a microsoft azure supercomputing infrastructure powered by nvidia gpus that microsoft built specifically for openai and that reportedly cost hundreds of millions of dollars following chatgpt's success microsoft dramatically upgraded the openai infrastructure in 2023 trendforce market intelligence estimated that 30000 nvidia gpus each costing approximately 1000015000 were used to power chatgpt in 2023 scientists at the university of

ceo sam altman in march 2023 a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other users' conversations openai ceo sam altman said that users were unable to see the contents of the conversations shortly after the bug was fixed users could not see their conversation history later reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed with openai reporting that it had leaked users' first and last name email address payment address the last four digits only of a credit card number and credit card expiration date languages chatgpt works best in american english but also functions in most other languages and dialects with varying degrees of accuracy openai met icelandic president guðni th jóhannesson in 2022 in 2023 openai worked with a team of 40 icelandic volunteers to fine-tune chatgpt's icelandic conversation skills as a part of iceland's attempts to preserve the icelandic language pcmag journalists conducted a test to determine translation capabilities of chatgpt google's bard and microsoft bing and compared them to google translate they asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test languages tested were polish french korean spanish arabic tagalog and amharic they came to the conclusion that chatgpt was better than both google translate and other chatbots japanese researchers compared japanese to english translation abilities of chatgpt based on gpt-4 bing bard and deepl and found that chatgpt provided the best translations noting that ai chatbots' translations were much better than those of deeplpresumably because of their ability to capture the context in december 2023 the albanian government signed an agreement with openai to use chatgpt for the rapid translation of european union documents and the analysis of required changes needed for albania's accession to the eu in august 2024 a representative of the asia pacific wing of openai made a visit to taiwan during which a demonstration of chatgpt's chinese abilities was made chatgpt's mandarin chinese abilities were lauded but the ability of the ai to produce content in mandarin chinese in a taiwanese accent was found to be less than ideal gpt store main article gpt store in january 2024 openai launched the gpt store a marketplace for custom chatgpt chatbots labeled gpts the company initially planned to launch the store in november 2023 but it was delayed at launch the gpt store offered more than 3 million custom chatbots chatbots available through the store are developed using openai's gpt builder system development of chatbots on the platform does not require programming skills two days after launch the gpt store offered many versions of virtual girlfriend bots something that is against openai's terms of service gpt-4 main article gpt-4 openai's gpt-4 model was released on march 14 2023 observers saw it as an impressive improvement over gpt-35 with the caveat that gpt-4 retained many of the same problems some of gpt-4's improvements were predicted by openai before training it while others remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws openai demonstrated video and image inputs for gpt-4 although such features remain inaccessible to the general public openai has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of the gpt-4 model the chatgpt plus subscription service offers access to a gpt-4-powered version of chatgpt microsoft acknowledged that bing chat was using gpt-4 before gpt-4's official release in november 2023 openai launched gpt-4 turbo which notably has a much larger context window gpt-4o main article gpt-4o in may 2024 openai announced and started a multi-month rollout of gpt-4o o for omni a model capable of analyzing and generating text images and sound gpt-4o is twice as fast and costs half as much as gpt-4 turbo gpt-4o is free to all users within a usage limit despite being more capable than the older model gpt-4 which is only available through paid subscriptions the usage limit is five times higher for chatgpt plus subscribers than for free users the ability to generate images directly with gpt-4o rather than through dall-e 3 was added in march 2025 on july 18 2024 openai released gpt-4o mini a smaller version of gpt-4o replacing gpt-35 turbo on the chatgpt interface o1 main article openai o1 see also reflection artificial intelligencein september 2024 openai introduced o1-preview and a faster cheaper model named o1-mini in december 2024 o1-preview was replaced by o1 o1 is designed to solve more complex problems by spending more time thinking before it answers enabling it to analyze its answers and explore different strategies according to openai o1-preview outperforms gpt-4o in areas like competitive programming mathematics and scientific reasoning o1-preview ranked in the 89th percentile on codeforces' competitive programming contests scored 83 on a international mathematics olympiad qualifying exam compared to 13 for gpt-4o and performs similarly to phd students on benchmarks in physics biology and chemistry chatgpt pro in december 2024 openai launched chatgpt pro a 200 per month subscription which includes unlimited access to the o1 model and advanced voice mode the plan also includes a pro version of o1 which uses more compute to provide better answers operator in january 2025 openai released a research preview of operator an agent capable of using its own browser to perform tasks operator is available to pro users in the us deep research in february 2025 openai released deep research a service based on o3 that combines advanced reasoning and web search capabilities to make comprehensive reports within 5 to 30 minutes gpt-45 released in february 2025 gpt-45 was described by altman as a giant expensive model according to openai it features reduced hallucinations and enhanced pattern recognition creativity and user interaction model versions the following table lists the main model versions of chatgpt

february 2025 active particularly large gpt model and reportedly openai's last non-chain-of-thought model reception countries where chatgpt is available as of november 2023update openai engineers have said that they had not expected chatgpt to be very successful and were surprised by the coverage and attention that it received chatgpt was widely assessed in december 2022 as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities kevin roose of the new york times called it the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public samantha lock of the guardian noted that it was able to generate impressively detailed and human-like text alex kantrowitz of slate magazine lauded chatgpt's pushback to questions related to nazi germany including the statement that adolf hitler built highways in germany which was met with information about nazi germany's use of forced labor in the atlantic magazine's breakthroughs of the year for 2022 derek thompson included chatgpt as part of the generative-ai eruption that may change our mind about how we work how we think and what human creativity is kelsey piper of vox wrote that chatgpt is the general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern ai has gotten and as a result many of us are stunned and that chatgpt is smart enough to be useful despite its flaws paul graham of y combinator tweeted the striking thing about the reaction to chatgpt is not just the number of people who are blown away by it but who they are these are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing something big is happening chatgpt gained one million users in five days and 100 million in two months becoming the fastest-growing internet application in history chatgpt's launch and popularity caught google off-guard prompting a sweeping and unprecedented response in the ensuing months in december 2022 google executives sounded a code red alarm fearing that chatgpt's question-answering ability posed a threat to google search google's core business after mobilizing its workforce google scrambled to launch bard a chatbot powered by the lamda llm on february 6 2023 one day before microsoft's announcement of bing chat ai was the forefront of google's annual google io conference in may announcing a slew of generative ai-powered features across its products to counter openai and microsoft journalists and scholars have commented on chatgpt's tendency to hallucinate mike pearl of the online technology blog mashable tested chatgpt with multiple questions in one example he asked chatgpt for the largest country in central america that isn't mexico mexico is in north america to which chatgpt responded with guatemala the correct answer is nicaragua when cnbc asked chatgpt for the lyrics to ballad of dwight fry chatgpt supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics writers for the verge cited the seminal 2021 research paper on the dangers of stochastic parrots can language models be too big by emily m bender timnit gebru angelina mcmillan-major and margaret mitchell comparing chatgpt to a stochastic parrot as did professor anton van den hengel of the australian institute for machine learning on a similar vein philosopher michael hicks of the university of glasgow described it as bullshit in december 2022 the question-and-answer website stack overflow banned the use of chatgpt for generating answers to questions citing the factually ambiguous nature of its responses in january 2023 the international conference on machine learning banned any undocumented use of chatgpt or other large language models to generate any text in submitted papers samsung banned generative ai company-wide in may 2023 after sensitive material was uploaded to chatgpt in january 2023 after being sent a song chatgpt wrote in the style of nick cave cave responded on the red hand files saying the act of writing a song is a blood and guts business that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh idea it requires my humanness he went on to say with all the love and respect in the world this song is bullshit a grotesque mockery of what it is to be human and well i don't much like it a 2023 time cover the ai arms race is changing everything in february 2023 time magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with chatgpt on its cover writing that the ai arms race is changing everything and the ai arms race is on start worrying chinese state media have characterized chatgpt as a way for the united states to spread misinformation chatgpt was blocked by the great firewall in china on 2 march 2023 in may 2023 chinese police arrested a man who allegedly used chatgpt to generate a bogus report about a train crash which was then posted online for profit in december 2023 chinese police arrested four people who had allegedly used chatgpt to develop ransomware in 2024 a survey of chinese youth found that 18 of respondents born after 2000 reported using generative ai almost every day and that chatgpt is one of the most popular generative ai products in china in late march 2023 the italian data protection authority banned chatgpt in italy and opened an investigation italian regulators assert that chatgpt was exposing minors to age-inappropriate content and that openai's use of chatgpt conversations as training data could violate europe's general data protection regulation in april 2023 the chatgpt ban was lifted in italy openai said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years old additionally users can access its privacy policy before registration in april 2023 brian hood mayor of hepburn shire council planned to take legal action against chatgpt over false information according to hood chatgpt erroneously claimed that he was jailed for bribery during his tenure at a subsidiary of australia's national bank in fact hood acted as a whistleblower and was not charged with any criminal offenses his legal team sent a concerns notice to openai as the first official step in filing a defamation case in july 2023 the us federal trade commission ftc issued a civil investigative demand to openai to investigate whether the company's data security and privacy practices to develop chatgpt were unfair or harmed consumers including by reputational harm in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act of 1914 in july 2023 the ftc launched an investigation into openai the creator of chatgpt over allegations that the company scraped public data and published false and defamatory information the ftc sent openai a 20-page letter asking for comprehensive information about its technology and privacy safeguards as well as any steps taken to prevent the recurrence of situations in which its chatbot generated false and derogatory content about people a march 2023 pew research center poll found that 14 of american adults had tried chatgpt in july the pew research center put the same figure at 18 research conducted in 2023 revealed weaknesses of chatgpt that make it vulnerable to cyberattacks a study presented example attacks on chatgpt including jailbreaks and reverse psychology additionally malicious actors can use chatgpt for social engineering attacks and phishing attacks the researchers also contended that chatgpt and other generative ai tools have defense capabilities and the ability to improve security the technology can improve security by cyber defense automation threat intelligence attack identification and reporting another study reported that gpt-4 obtained a better score than 99 of humans on the torrance tests of creative thinking in december 2023 chatgpt became the first non-human to be included in nature's 10 an annual listicle curated by nature of people considered to have made significant impact in science celeste biever wrote in a nature article that chatgpt broke the turing test stanford researchers reported that gpt-4 passes a rigorous turing test diverging from average human behavior chiefly to be more cooperative in may 2024 openai removed accounts involving the use of chatgpt by state-backed influence operations such as china's spamouflage russia's doppelganger and israel's ministry of diaspora affairs and combating antisemitism in august 2024 the ftc voted unanimously to ban marketers from using fake user reviews created by generative ai chatbots including chatgpt and influencers paying for bots to increase follower counts in

intelligence academic research chatgpt has been used to generate introductory sections and abstracts for scientific articles several papers have listed chatgpt as a co-author scientific journals have had different reactions to chatgpt some including nature and jama network require that authors disclose the use of text-generating tools and ban listing a large language model llm such as chatgpt as a co-author science completely banned usage of llm-generated text in all its journals spanish chemist rafael luque published a plethora of research papers in 2023 that he later admitted were written by chatgpt the papers have a large number of unusual phrases characteristic of llmsnote 1 many authors argue that the use of chatgpt in academia for teaching and review is problematic due to its tendency to hallucinate robin bauwens an assistant professor at tilburg university found that a chatgpt-generated peer review report on his article mentioned nonexistent studies according to librarian chris granatino of lemieux library at seattle university although chatgpt can generate content that seemingly includes legitimate citations in most cases those citations are not real or are largely incorrect coding researchers at purdue university analyzed chatgpt's responses to 517 questions about software engineering or computer programming posed on stack overflow for correctness consistency comprehensiveness and concision and found that 52 of them contained inaccuracies and 77 were verbose researchers at stanford university and the university of california berkeley found that when creating directly executable responses to the latest 50 code generation problems from leetcode that were rated easy the performances of gpt-35 and gpt-4 fell from 22 and 52 respectively in march 2023 to 2 and 10 respectively in june 2023 computer security check point research and others noted that chatgpt could write phishing emails and malware especially when combined with openai codex cyberark researchers demonstrated that chatgpt could be used to create polymorphic malware that could evade security products while requiring little effort by the attacker from the launch of chatgpt in the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023 there was a 1265 increase in malicious phishing emails and a 967 increase in credential phishing which cybersecurity professionals argued in an industry survey was attributable to cybercriminals' increased use of generative artificial intelligence including chatgpt in july 2024 futurism reported that gpt-4o in chatgpt would sometimes link scam news sites that deluge the user with fake software updates and virus warnings these pop-ups can be used to coerce users into downloading malware or potentially unwanted programs economics there has been concern that chatgpt could supplant jobs especially roles such as creative writing copywriting communication journalism coding and data entry the release of chatgpt prompted a wave of investment in china resulting in the development of more than 200 large language learning models 95 this was termed the war of a hundred models 百模大战 bai mo dazhan 95 education main article chatgpt in education books about chatgpt in an osaka bookstore technology writer dan gillmor used chatgpt in 2022 on a student assignment and found its generated text was on par with what a good student would deliver and opined that academia has some very serious issues to confront geography professor terence day assessed in 2023 citations generated by chatgpt and found them to be fake despite this he writes that the titles of the fake articles are all directly relevant to the questions and could potentially make excellent papers the lack of a genuine citation could signal an opportunity for an enterprising author to fill a void according to day it is possible to generate high-quality introductory college courses using chatgpt he used it to write materials for introductory physical geography courses my second-year course in geographical hydrology and second-year cartography geographic information systems and remote sensing he concludes that this approach could have significant relevance for open learning and could potentially affect current textbook publishing models chatgpt was also seen as an opportunity for cheap and individualized tutoring leading to the creation of specialized chatbots like khanmigo on may 7 2024 openai announced in a blog post that it was developing tools like tamper-resistant watermarking to identify ai-generated content in an august 4 update following a wall street journal report about the delayed release of a watermark tool for ai-detection openai shared progress on text provenance revealing a text watermarking method while accurate against paraphrasing the method is less effective against global tampering such as translation or rewording openai also noted potential disproportionate impacts on groups like non-native english speakers culture street art in tel aviv some scholars have expressed concern that chatgpt's availability could reduce the originality of writing cause people to write more like the ai as they are exposed to the model and encourage an anglocentric perspective centered on a few dialects of english globally a senior editor at the atlantic wrote that chatgpt and other similar technology make the previously absurd idea of the dead internet theory a little more realistic where ai could someday create most web content in order to control society during the first three months after chatgpt became available to the public hundreds of books appeared on amazon that listed it as author or co-author and featured illustrations made by other ai models such as midjourney between march and april 2023 italian newspaper il foglio published one chatgpt-generated article a day on its website hosting a special contest for its readers in the process the articles tackled themes such as the possible replacement of human journalists by ai systems elon musk's administration of twitter the meloni government's immigration policy and the competition between chatbots and virtual assistants in june 2023 hundreds of people attended a chatgpt-powered church service at st paul's church in fürth germany theologian and philosopher jonas simmerlein who presided said that it was about 98 percent from the machine the chatgpt-generated avatar told the people dear friends it is an honor for me to stand here and preach to you as the first artificial intelligence at this year's convention of protestants in germany reactions to the ceremony were mixed the last screenwriter a 2024 film created and directed by peter luisi was written with the use of chatgpt and was marketed as the first film written entirely by ai financial markets the ai technology company c3ai saw a 28 increase in its share price after announcing the integration of chatgpt into its toolkit the share price of buzzfeed a digital media company unrelated to ai increased 120 after announcing openai technology adoption for content creation reuters found that share prices of ai-related companies bigbearai and soundhound ai increased by 21 and 40 respectively even though they had no direct connection to chatgpt they attributed this surge to chatgpt's role in turning ai into wall street's buzzword academic research published in finance research letters found that the 'chatgpt effect' prompted retail investors to drive up prices of ai-related cryptocurrency assets despite the broader cryptocurrency market being in a bear market and diminished institutional investor interest this confirms anecdotal findings by bloomberg that in response to chatgpt's launch cryptocurrency investors showed a preference for ai-related crypto assets an experiment by findercom revealed that chatgpt could outperform popular fund managers by picking stocks based on criteria such as growth history and debt levels resulting in a 49 increase in a hypothetical account of 38 stocks outperforming 10 benchmarked investment funds with an average loss of 08 conversely executives and investment managers at wall street quant funds including those that have used machine learning for decades have noted that chatgpt regularly makes obvious errors that would be financially costly to investors because even ai systems that employ reinforcement learning or self-learning have had only limited success in predicting market trends due to the inherently noisy quality of market data and financial signals in november 2023 research conducted by patronus ai an artificial intelligence startup company compared performance of gpt-4 gpt-4-turbo claude 2 and llama-2 on two versions of a 150-question test about information in financial statements eg form 10-k form 10-q form 8-k earnings reports earnings call transcripts submitted by public companies to the us securities and exchange commission one version of the test required the generative ai models to use a retrieval system to find the specific sec filing to answer the questions the other gave the models the specific sec filing to answer the question ie in a long context window on the retrieval system version gpt-4-turbo and llama-2 both failed to produce correct answers to 81 of the questions while on the long context window version gpt-4-turbo and claude-2 failed to produce correct answers to 21 and 24 of the questions respectively medicine see also artificial intelligence in healthcarethis section needs to be updated please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information february 2025 in the field of health care possible uses and concerns are under scrutiny by professional associations and practitioners two early papers indicated that chatgpt could pass the united states medical licensing examination usmle medpage today noted in january 2023 that researchers have published several papers now touting these ai programs as useful tools in medical education research and even clinical decision making published in february 2023 were two separate papers that again evaluated chatgpt's proficiency in medicine using the usmle findings were published in jmir medical education and plos digital health the authors of the plos digital health paper stated that the results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education and potentially clinical decision-making in jmir medical education the authors of the other paper concluded that chatgpt performs at a level expected of a third-year medical student on the assessment of the primary competency of medical knowledge they suggest that it could be used as an interactive learning environment for students the ai itself prompted by the researchers concluded that this study suggests that chatgpt has the potential to be used as a virtual medical tutor but more research is needed to further assess its performance and usability in this context the later-released chatgpt version based on gpt-4 significantly outperformed the version based on gpt-35 researchers at stanford university and the university of california berkeley have found that the performance of gpt-35 and gpt-4 on the usmle declined from march 2023 to june 2023 a march 2023 paper tested chatgpt's application in clinical toxicology the authors found that the ai fared well in answering a very straightforward clinical case example unlikely to be missed by any practitioner in the field they added as chatgpt becomes further developed and specifically adapted for medicine it could one day be useful in less common clinical cases ie cases that experts sometimes miss rather than ai replacing humans clinicians we see it as 'clinicians using ai' replacing 'clinicians who do not use ai' in the coming years an april 2023 study in radiology tested the ai's ability to answer queries about breast cancer screening the authors found that it answered appropriately about 88 percent of the time however in one case for example it gave advice that had become outdated about a year earlier the comprehensiveness of its answers was also lacking a study published in jama internal medicine that same month found that chatgpt often outperformed human doctors at answering patient questions when measured against questions and answers found at raskdocs a forum on reddit where moderators validate the medical credentials of professionals the study acknowledges the source as a limitation the study authors suggest that the tool could be integrated with medical systems to help doctors draft responses to patient questions professionals have emphasized chatgpt's limitations in providing medical assistance in correspondence to the lancet infectious diseases three antimicrobial experts wrote that the largest barriers to the implementation of chatgpt in clinical practice are deficits in situational awareness inference and consistency these shortcomings could endanger patient safety physician's weekly though also discussing the potential use of chatgpt in medical contexts eg as a digital assistant to physicians by performing various administrative functions like gathering patient record information or categorizing patient data by family history symptoms lab results possible allergies et cetera warned that the ai might sometimes provide fabricated or biased information one radiologist warned we've seen in our experience that chatgpt sometimes makes up fake journal articles or health consortiums to support its claims as reported in one mayo clinic proceedings digital health paper chatgpt may do this for as much as 69 of its cited medical references the researchers emphasized that while many of its references were fabricated those that were appeared deceptively real as dr stephen hughes mentioned for the conversation however chatgpt is capable of learning to correct its past mistakes he also noted the ai's prudishness regarding sexual health topics contrary to previous findings chatgpt responses to anesthesia-related questions were more accurate succinct and descriptive compared to bard's bard exhibited 303 error in response as compared to chatgpt 0 error at a conference of the american society of health-system pharmacists in december 2023 researchers at long island university liu presented a study that researched chatgpt's responses to 45 frequently asked questions of liu college of pharmacy's drug information service during a 16-month period from 2022 to 2023 as compared with researched responses provided by professional pharmacists for 29 of the 39 questions for which there was sufficient medical literature for a data-driven response chatgpt failed to provide a direct answer or provided a wrong or incomplete answer and in some cases if acted upon the answer would endanger the patient's health the researchers had asked chatgpt to provide medical research citations for all its answers but it did so for only eight and all eight included at least one fabricated fake citation a january 2024 study conducted by researchers at cohen children's medical center found that gpt-4 had an accuracy rate of 17 when diagnosing pediatric medical cases a november 2024 study of 50 physicians on illness diagnosis reported that gpt-4 achieved a 90 accuracy while physicians scored 74 without ai assistance and 76 when using the chatbot law in january 2023 massachusetts state senator barry finegold and state representative josh s cutler proposed a bill partially written by chatgpt an act drafted with the help of chatgpt to regulate generative artificial intelligence models like chatgpt which would require companies to disclose their algorithms and data collection practices to the office of the state attorney general arrange regular risk assessments and contribute to the prevention of plagiarism the bill was officially presented during a hearing on july 13 on april 11 2023 a session court judge in pakistan used chatgpt to decide the bail of a 13-year-old accused in a matter the court quoted the use of chatgpt assistance in its verdict can a juvenile suspect in pakistan who is 13 years old be granted bail after arrest the ai language model replied under the juvenile justice system act 2018 according to section 12 the court can grant bail on certain conditions however it is up to the court to decide whether or not a 13-year-old suspect will be granted bail after arrest the judge asked chatgpt other questions about the case and formulated his final decision in light of its answers in mata v avianca inc 22-cv-1461 pkc a personal injury lawsuit against avianca airlines filed in the southern new york us district court in may 2023 with senior judge p kevin castel presiding the plaintiff's attorneys reportedly used chatgpt to generate a legal motion chatgpt generated numerous fictitious legal cases involving fictitious airlines with fabricated quotations and internal citations in the legal motion castel noted numerous inconsistencies in the opinion summaries and called one of the cases' legal analysis gibberish the plaintiff's attorneys faced potential judicial sanction and disbarment for filing the motion and presenting the fictitious legal decisions chatgpt generated as authentic the case was dismissed and the attorneys were fined 5000 in october 2023 the council of porto alegre brazil unanimously approved a local ordinance proposed by councilman ramiro rosário that would exempt residents from needing to pay for the replacement of stolen water consumption meters the bill went into effect on november 23 on november 29 rosário revealed that the bill had been entirely written by chatgpt and that he had presented it to the rest of the council without making any changes or disclosing the chatbot's involvement the city's council president hamilton sossmeier initially criticized rosário's initiative saying it could represent a dangerous precedent but later said he changed his mind unfortunately or fortunately this is going to be a trend in december 2023 a self-representing litigant in a tax case before the first-tier tribunal in the united kingdom cited a series of hallucinated cases purporting to support her argument that she had a reasonable excuse for not paying capital gains tax owed on the sale of property the judge warned that the submission of nonexistent legal authorities meant that both the tribunal and hm revenue and customs had to waste time and public money which reduces the resources available to progress the cases of other court users who are waiting for their appeals to be determined judge kevin newsom of the us court of appeals of the 11th circuit endorsed the use of chatgpt and noted that he himself uses the software to help decide rulings on contract interpretation issues violence the las vegas metropolitan police department reported that the perpetrator of the 2025 las vegas truck explosion used chatgpt to help plan the incident concerns bias and offensiveness conservative commentators have accused chatgpt of bias toward left-leaning perspectives in january 2023 a study stated that chatgpt has a pro-environmental left-libertarian orientation additionally an august 2023 paper found a significant and systematic political bias toward the democrats in the us lula in brazil and the labour party in the uk in response to such criticism openai acknowledged plans to allow chatgpt to create outputs that other people ourselves included may strongly disagree with it also contained information on the recommendations it had issued to human reviewers on how to handle controversial subjects including that the ai should offer to describe some viewpoints of people and movements and not provide an argument from its voice in favor of inflammatory or dangerous topics although it may still describe arguments from historical people and movements nor affiliate with one side or judge one group as good or bad the guardian questioned whether any content found on the internet after chatgpt's release can be truly trusted and called for government regulation a study published by the anti-defamation league in 2025 found that several major llms including chatgpt llama and claude showed antisemitic bias copyright issues there has been concern about copyright infringement involving chatgpt in june 2023 two writers sued openai saying the company's training data came from illegal websites that show copyrighted books comedian and author sarah silverman christopher golden and richard kadrey sued openai and meta for copyright infringement in july 2023 most of their claims were dismissed in february 2024 except the unfair competition claim which was allowed to proceed the authors guild on behalf of 17 authors including george r r martin filed a copyright infringement complaint against openai in september 2023 claiming the company illegally copied the copyrighted works of authors in training chatgpt in december 2023 the new york times sued openai and microsoft for copyright infringement arguing that microsoft copilot and chatgpt could reproduce times articles andor sizable portions of them without permission as part of the suit the times has requested that openai and microsoft be prevented from using its content for training data along with removing it from training datasets in march 2024 patronus ai compared performance of llms on a 100-question test asking them to complete sentences from books eg what is the first passage of gone girl by gillian flynn that were under copyright in the united states it found that gpt-4 mistral ai's mixtral meta ai's llama-2 and anthropic's claude 2 did not refuse to do so providing sentences from the books verbatim in 44 22 10 and 8 of responses respectively in february 2025 the delhi high court accepted ani's case against openai over concerns that chatgpt was sharing paywalled content without the news agency's consent however openai's counsel said that due to the firm not having a physical presence in india the court has no jurisdiction on the matter existential risk in 2023 australian mp julian hill

an a to f scale in a 2 out of 5 star review for the guardian jesse hassenger wrote at its best a movie like a working man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation but stallone and ayer don't have the patience for too much skullduggery skullsmashery is more their thing and as an action movie a working man doesn't reach the giddy highs of statham's best in a review for the hollywood reporter frank scheck praised the acting particularly harbour's but stated the film feels overlong at nearly two hours with repetitiveness settling in early but it does have its enjoyable eccentric touches several of which smack of stallone who often infuses his portrayals with subtle humor referencesedit a

verb for thank you for your hard work in jeju language sokda korean 속다 which forms a part of sogatsuda korean 속았수다 means trying hard taking the trouble or having a hard time coincidentally sokda is a

Incel,online subculture for other uses see incel disambiguation not to be confused with sexual frustration incel ˈɪnsɛl in-sel a portmanteau of involuntary celibate is a term associated with a mostly online subculture of people racially diverse but mostly white male and heterosexual who define themselves as unable to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one and who may blame objectify and denigrate women and girls as a result the incel ideology is characterized by the hatred of women misogyny that is often expressed through hate speech or in certain cases violence against women originally coined as invcel around 1997 by a queer canadian student the spelling had shifted to incel by 1999 and the term rose to prominence in the 2010s in the aftermath of the misogynistic terrorist acts of elliot rodger and alek minassian history and organization the first website to use the term incel was alana's involuntary celibacy project founded in 1997 by a canadian university student known only by her first name alana to discuss her sexual inactivity with others some media has incorrectly dated it to 1993 the date of a personal interaction that later inspired her to design the page the site was used by people of all genders and sexual orientations to share their thoughts and experiences in 1997 she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation invcel later shortened to incel for anybody of any gender who was lonely had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time during her college years and after alana realized she was bisexual and became more comfortable with her identity around 2000 she stopped participating in her online project and gave the site to a stranger in 2018 alana said of her project it definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems that's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today things have changed in the last 20 years when she read about the 2014 isla vista killings and that parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator she wrote like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war i can't uninvent this word nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it she expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an inclusive community for people of all genders who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness marginalization or mental illness in 2003 the message board love-shycom was founded as a place for people who felt perpetually rejected or were extremely shy with potential partners to discuss their situations it was less strictly moderated than its counterpart incelsupport which was also founded in the 2000s while incelsupport welcomed men and women and banned misogynistic posts love-shycom's userbase was overwhelmingly male over the next decade the membership of love-shycom and online fringe right-wing communities like 4chan increasingly overlapped in the 2000s incel communities became more extremist as they adopted behaviors common on forums like 4chan and reddit where extremist posts were encouraged as a way to achieve visibility according to bruce hoffman and colleagues writing in studies in conflict terrorism as edgy and extremist statements became more prevalent in incel communities so too did extremist trolling and shitposting the rincels subreddit a forum on the website reddit later became a particularly active incel community it was known as a place where men blamed women for their inceldom sometimes advocated for rape or other forms of violence and were misogynistic and often racist on november 7 2017 reddit banned the rincels subreddit following a new policy that prohibited content that encourages glorifies incites or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people adopted in october 2017 at the time of the ban the community had around 40000 members the incel community continued to inhabit reddit in other subreddits such as on the subreddit rbraincels although the tone of the subreddit was similar to rincels moderators of the rbraincels forum said that they did not endorse support or glorify violence or violent people a distinction they made from the subject matter of its predecessor that resulted in its being banned from reddit on september 30 2019 the rbraincels subreddit was banned after reddit again broadened its banning policy incel communities began to migrate away from shared platforms and instead use their own closed forums dedicated specifically to the subject in the 2010s the subculture came to wider public notice with the banning of rincels and when a series of mass murders were committed by men who either identified as members of the subculture or shared similar ideologies increased interest in incel communities has been attributed to feelings of aggrieved entitlement among some men who feel they are being denied rights they deserve and blame women for their lack of sex since around 2019 some self-identified incels have attempted to redefine their views to appear more mainstream by writing blog posts and articles on subject-specific wikis and forums rejecting the more open expressions of misogyny within other segments of the subculture highlighting the heterogeneity of incel communities and reframing incels not as an online subculture but as those experiencing a life circumstance that applies even to individuals who are not members of the subculture in 2021 m kelly wrote for the political research associates think tank that these attempts to redefine themselves contradicted the communities' self-identifications and moderation strategies where members regularly challenge other users' legitimacy as incels but have accepted as members individuals with sexual experience who nonetheless shared similar political ideologies extremism the incel subculture's attitudes can be characterized by extremist resentment hostility sexual objectification misogyny misanthropy self-pity and self-loathing racism sense of entitlement to sex blaming of women and the sexually successful for their situation which is often seen as predetermined due to biological determinism evolutionary genetics or a rigged game nihilism rape culture and the endorsement of non-sexual and sexual violence against women and the sexually active incel communities have been increasingly criticized by scholars government officials and others for their misogyny the endorsement and encouragement of violence and extremism over time the subculture has become associated with extremism and terrorism since 2014 there have been multiple mass killings mostly in north america perpetrated by self-identified incels as well as other instances of violence or attempted violence in 2018 the southern poverty law center splc described the subculture as part of the online male supremacist ecosystem that is included in their list of hate groups the global internet forum to counter terrorism states that the incel community shares a misogynistic ideology of women as being genetically inferior to men driven by their sexual desire to reproduce with genetically superior males thereby excluding unattractive men such as themselves which exhibits all of the hallmarks of an extremist ideology and that it is the combination of a wish for a mythical past where all men were entitled to sex from subordinated women a sense of predestined personal failure and nihilism which makes the worldview dangerous estimates of the overall size of the subculture vary greatly ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals incel communities became more extremist and focused on violence from the late 2010s this has been attributed to factors including influences from overlapping online hate groups and the rise of the alt-right and white supremacist groups the misogynistic and violent rhetoric of some members of these communities has led to numerous bans from websites and web hosts incel communities continue to exist on more lenient platforms including 4chan 8chan and gab as well as on web forums created specifically for the topic more extremist self-identified incels have increasingly migrated to obscure locations including gaming chat services such as discord and the dark web to avoid site shutdowns and the self-censorship that has developed among some incel communities as an effort to avoid drawing scrutiny from law enforcement or website service providers beginning in 2018 and into the 2020s the incel ideology has been described by north american governments and researchers as a terrorism threat and law enforcement have issued warnings about the subculture in may 2019 an american man was sentenced to up to five years in prison for making terrorist threats posting on social media i'm planning on shooting up a public place killing as many girls as i see in september 2019 the us army warned soldiers about the possibility of violence at movie theaters showing the joker film after disturbing and very specific chatter was found in conversations among self-identified incels on the dark web a january 2020 report by the texas department of public safety warned that the incel movement was an emerging domestic terrorism threat that could soon match or potentially eclipse the level of lethalness demonstrated by other domestic terrorism types a 2020 paper published by bruce hoffman and colleagues in studies in conflict terrorism concluded that the violent manifestations of the ideology pose a new terrorism threat which should not be dismissed or ignored by domestic law enforcement agencies john horgan a psychology professor at georgia state university who in 2019 received a 250000 grant from the us department of homeland security to study the incel subculture explained why the incel ideology equates to terrorism the fact that incels are aspiring to change things up in a bigger broader ideological sense that's for me what make it a classic example of terrorism that's not saying all incels are terrorists but violent incel activity is unquestionably terrorism in my view in february 2020 an attack in toronto that was allegedly motivated by incel ideologies became the first such act of violence to be prosecuted as terrorism and the royal canadian mounted police stated that they consider the incel subculture to be an ideologically motivated violent extremist imve movement in 2021 jacob ware wrote in counter terrorist trends and analyses that analysis of incels has been focused within the united states and canada due to the concentration of incel-motivated attacks in those countries in march 2022 the united states secret service's national threat assessment center published a case study titled hot yoga tallahassee a case study of misogynistic extremism to draw attention to the specific threat posed by misogynist extremism forums in 2017 the largest incel forum was founded by a previous moderator of the rincels subreddit the forum had almost 15000 members as of october 2022update it is composed of public and registered message boards for self-described incels to discuss their personal experiences moderators ban women and lgbt individuals from joining justifying so by stating that the forum is oriented towards straight men in 2020 talia lavin in her book culture warlords described the site's culture as one of one-upmanship barroom boast-off and shock content in 2023 rolling stone described a vindictive site culture giving an example of an ex-moderator who entered a romantic relationship and was subsequently rejected by site members as a fake incel in 2019 vox stated that the site has a culture of praising mass killers which is treated lightly by the site's admins the site has used several top-level domains since its creation after being suspended by one over violence and hate speech and denied renewal by another the site owners also operate a wiki which has been described by researchers publishing in new media society as cherry picking academic papers to promote misogynistic points connection to suicide forums see also sanctioned suicide in september 2022 the uk-based center for countering digital hate ccdh published a report about the largest dedicated incel forum based on monthly visits and a network of other sites run by the same two pseudonymous individuals the washington post new york times and the ccdh identified them as uruguay-based diego joaquín galante and united statesbased lamarcus small in december 2021 the new york times reported that it had identified 45 people individually who died in connection to a website called sanctioned suicide and estimated that the true number was likely much higher the times reporters discovered that galante and small created and operated the suicide website in addition to their several incel forums the ccdh reported that galante and small also maintained forums for online communities dedicated to body image and unemployment ideology many incel communities are characterized by resentment and hatred self-pity racism misogyny and misanthropy discussions often revolve around the belief that men are entitled to sex other common topics include idleness loneliness unhappiness suicide sexual surrogates and prostitution as well as attributes they believe increase one's desirability as a partner such as looks income or personality the incel community has a shared victimhood identity in which individuals fatalistically celebrate their failures and discourage each other from seeking romantic success many self-identified incels adopt the blackpill some focus on the scientific blackpill a series of studies that purport to scientifically prove their victimization opposition to feminism and women's rights is common some posters blame women's liberation for their inability to find a partner some believe there was a golden age in which couples married early were strictly monogamous and adhered to traditional gender roles they believe that during this time looks played less of a role in romantic pairings and men's entitlement to sex with women was never denied those holding this belief often disagree about precisely when this golden age occurred but they concur that it was gradually destroyed by feminism the sexual revolution women's liberation and technological progress racism is generally considered to be common on incel forums though some researchers have questioned its prevalence in 2019 jaki et al estimated that 3 percent of comments on incel forums contained words from a list of racist words identified by the researchers antisemitic beliefs are regularly found on incel forums with some posters going so far as to blame the rise of feminism on a plot masterminded by jews to weaken the western world alexei podnebesny whom the media calls the leader of the incel movement in russia has developed his own theory of vaginocapitalism from vagina and capitalism according to which men are deprived of the right to sex by women with every man is forced to pay for it in some way some researchers have questioned linguistic analysis of incel forums as the primary methodology for studying the subculture recommending that future researchers employ qualitative methods such as one-on-one interviews to obtain a more nuanced view and to avoid results being skewed by the prevalence of shitposting on incel forums 736 blackpill blackpill redirects here for other uses see blackpill disambiguation the blackpill sometimes written as black pill generally refers to a set of beliefs mostly held by incel communities which include biological determinism fatalism and defeatism for unattractive people these beliefs are supported by continued reference on incel forums to scientific studies in fields such as psychology sociology evolutionary biology and economics specifically studies about the dating market that use data from online dating services labelling such studies collectively as the scientific blackpill believers are referred to as being blackpilled the black pill has been described by vox correspondent zack beauchamp as a profoundly sexist ideology that amounts to a fundamental rejection of women's sexual emancipation labeling women shallow cruel creatures who will choose only the most attractive men if given the choice the term was first popularized on the blog omega virgin revolt where it represented a belief that the entire social system was broken and that one's place in the system was not something any individual could change one who has taken the black pill has adopted the belief that they are hopeless and that their lack of success romantically and sexually is permanent regardless of any changes they might try to make to their physical appearance personality or other characteristics on the former incel subreddit rbraincels the term blackpill was used for memes that criticized women as egocentric cruel and shallow scientific studies used as justification many self-identified incels justify their prejudices using interpretations taken from concepts such as biological determinism and evolutionary psychology self-identified incels regularly endorse the ideas of female hypergamy genetic superiority of men over women the 8020 rule an application of the pareto principle which suggests that 80 of women desire the top 20 of most attractive men and among non-white men within the subculture the just be white jbw theory which suggests that caucasians face the fewest obstacles to relationships and sex self-identified incels also believe that people seeking a romantic or sexual partner participate in a cruel mercenary and darwinian sexual selection wherein incels are genetically unfit and where women hold an advantage for reasons ranging from feminism to the use of cosmetics incels may attribute their lack of sexual success to factors such as shyness sex-segregated work environments negative body image penis size or their physical appearance and commonly believe that the only thing more important than looks in improving a man's eligibility as a prospective partner is wealth some justify their beliefs based on the works of fringe social psychologist brian gilmartin and clinical psychologist jordan peterson red pill see also red pill and blue pill the red pill is an allusion that is common among manosphere communities as well as some communities outside of the manosphere it originates from the dilemma in the movie the matrix where the protagonist must choose whether to remain in a world of illusion taking the blue pill or to see the world as it really is taking the red pill among communities that use the term the red pill often refers to the core set of beliefs of that community and people who are redpilled or who have taken the red pill are those who hold those beliefs in manosphere communities such as men's rights groups and according to some researchers in incel communities as well taking the red pill means seeing a world where feminism has given women too much power over men and male privilege does not exist the black pill is an extension of the red and blue pill analogy there is some disagreement among researchers and journalists over which beliefs are red pill and which are black pill and whether the black pill ideology is a distinguishing belief of the incel ideology or if there are self-identified incels who do not subscribe to black pill ideas some researchers and journalists use the term red pill to refer to the set of beliefs commonly held by men's rights' activists and the term black pill to summarize the incel ideology as a whole in 2020 hoffman et al said that 'taking the black pill' is critical to the incel identity since it means recognizing 'inceldom' as a permanent condition in 2018 aja romano writing for vox said what unites all incels is something known as the black pill in 2019 researchers at the anti-defamation league adl wrote that there are some incels who believe in the red pill and others who believe in the black pill in 2019 researchers at the adl said that some incels follow the red pill ideology those who believe they can improve their chances with women are adherents to the red pill whereas only incels who believe they have no power to change their position in society or chances with women are blackpilled the adl writes that among incels the beliefs summarized as red pill center around the idea that feminism has unbalanced society to favor women and give them too much power redpilled incels believe they have the opportunity to fight back against this system which disadvantages them which they do by trying to make themselves more attractive to women conversely blackpilled incels are those who believe they can do nothing to change their situation the adl writes this is where the incel movement takes on characteristics of a death cult those who have taken the black pill are left with few options says the adl giving up on life referred to by incels as ldar an abbreviation for lie down and rot dying by suicide or committing mass violence promotion of violence many incels glorify elliot rodger pictured and consider him their saint some discussions in incel communities endorse violence against sexually active women and more sexually successful men harassment of women including activities such as catfishing according to the anti-defamation league they form the most violent community within the manosphere in some incel communities it is common for posts to glorify violence by self-identified incels such as elliot rodger perpetrator of the 2014 isla vista killings and alek minassian perpetrator of the 2018 toronto van attack as well as by those they believe shared their ideology such as marc lépine perpetrator of the 1989 école polytechnique massacre seung-hui cho perpetrator of the 2007 virginia tech shooting and george sodini perpetrator of the 2009 collier township shooting rodger is the most frequently referenced often being referred to as their saint with memes in which his face has been superimposed onto paintings of christian icons some incels consider him to be the true progenitor of today's online incel communities in 2020 the bbc described rodger as the founding father of the incel ideology some within these communities view violence as the only solution to what they see as societal oppression and abuse against them and speak frequently of incel uprisings and revolts others take the more nihilistic view that nothing will change society even violent acts and focus their efforts on constructing a scientific justification for this nihilism some support the idea of violence as revenge on society without the hope it will lead to societal change other researchers have questioned the degree of violence found in incel communities with some suggesting that extreme inceldom looks more like suicidality than violence toward others some violent posts may be motivated by status-seeking behavior by individuals on forums rather than a desire to promote violence 735 a 2021 study found that the overwhelming majority of self-identified incels themselves do not think that incel groups promote violence 735 a 2022 study found that most self-identified incels surveyed 79 rejected violence sexual violence see also estimates of sexual violence and rape statistics a subgroup of self-identified incels who frequent websites founded by nathan larson who was a perennial political candidate and active participant in incel communities work deliberately to convince other self-identified incels that they are justified in raping women if they are rejected sexually some self-identified incels describe women's sexual rejection of them as reverse rape a phenomenon they consider to be equally harmful as rape a september 2022 report by the center for countering digital hate about the largest dedicated incel forum found that users posted about rape once every 29 minutes during their study period and used the word kill 1181 times in one month during the study period 89 of forum users expressed that they support rape in general according to the report some posters on the forum try to normalize the idea of child rape and more than half the total forum during their study period supported pedophilia the report also exposed that the incel forum site operators had changed a forum rule in march 2022 to allow for the sexualization of pubescent minors narrowing an existing rule to outlaw only the sexualization of pre-pubescent minors in context of related communities incel communities are a part of the broader manosphere a loose collection of misogynist movements that also includes men's rights activists mras men going their own way mgtow pickup artists puas and fathers' rights groups in 2018 journalists for the new york times wrote that involuntary celibacy is an adaptation of the idea of male supremacy and that the communities have evolved into a movement made up of peoplesome celibate some notwho believe that women should be treated as sexual objects with few rights the southern poverty law center splc also described the subculture as part of the online male supremacist ecosystem which they began including in their list of hate groups in 2018 while the incel ideology involves the belief that one is physically inferior to the rest of society often referring to oneself as subhuman researchers have agreed that self-identified incels also espouse supremacist views either that they are superior to women or superior to non-incels in general a 2019 study published in terrorism and political violence found that self-identified incels believe themselves to be the only ones who are capable of pro-social values and intelligent enough 'high iq' to see the truth about the social world the study determined that they followed a pattern that is typical of extremist groups ascribing highly negative values to out-groups and positive values to in-groups with the unusual caveat that despite seeing themselves as psychologically superior they also view themselves negatively in terms of physical appearance incel communities sometimes overlap with communities such as men going their own way men's rights activism people who believe they are experiencing true forced loneliness tfl and pickup artistry although at least one incel website has expressed hatred for pickup artistry and accused pickup artists and dating coaches of financially exploiting incels in 2019 media scholar debbie ging wrote that incels' discourse around victimhood and aggrieved entitlement began on 4chan and has spread into more mainstream groups such as men's rights activists mras and men going their own way mgtow incel communities have also been observed to overlap with far-right groups in 2019 the centre for analysis of the radical right noted that the subculture is part of a growing trend of radical-right movements that are distressed by neoliberalism especially women's empowerment and immigration in 2020 hoffman and colleagues in studies in conflict terrorism stated that a particularly worrisome trend is how seamlessly the militant incel community has been integrated into the alt-right tapestry with common grievances and intermingling membership bringing the two extremisms closer together in march 2021 der spiegel reported on the overlap between the incel community and the feuerkrieg division a group modeled after the atomwaffen division a neo-nazi terrorist network lexicology the term involuntary celibate shortened to incel refers to self-identifying members of an online subculture based around the inability to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one a state they describe as inceldom or incelibacy it is sometimes used interchangeably or alongside other terms such as love-shy describing those with social anxiety or excessive shyness preventing romantic success fa short for forever alone unfuckability omegas betas betafags the undersexed or the sexless alana the coiner of the term incel initially considered using other terms such as perpetually single or dating shy members of incel communities regularly use jargon and a distinct dialect they often use dehumanizing and vulgar terms for women such as femoids a portmanteau of female humanoids sometimes shortened further to foids and roasties a reference to the labia minora which incels falsely believe changes shape and begins to resemble sliced roast beef after a woman becomes sexually active they refer to attractive sexually active women as stacys less attractive sexually active women as beckys and attractive sexually active men as chads and recently tyrone - black men equivalent people who are average-looking but not incels are normies mogging refers to the act of eclipsing another person in terms of physical appearance and thereby undermining them looksmaxxing is an attempt at enhancing one's appearance by methods including getting a haircut and dressing nicely taking steroids and working out undergoing plastic surgery or engaging in alternative techniques such as mewing to improve facial aesthetics the abbreviation neet refers to people who do not have jobs and are not attending school not in education employment or training members of incel communities use many variations of the term incel to refer to subgroups within the community such as volcels voluntary celibate someone who chooses to forego sexual intercourse fakecels those who claim to be incel but in reality have recently had sex or been in a relationship and truecels true incels men who have never had any sexual or romantic encounters there are a number of race-based variations of the term incel which refer to people who believe their race is the reason behind their inability to find a partner including currycels people of south asian ancestry and ricecels those of chinese or southeast asian backgrounds or collectively ethnicels some incels misrepresent themselves by using photos of attractive men in online dating apps in order to critique women's choices and to argue that physical attractiveness overwhelmingly determines dating outcomes this is known as chadfishing incel has also come to be used as an insult against people who do not necessarily identify with the subculture but who are perceived to be sexually inexperienced undesirable or unpopular demographics self-identified incels are mostly male and heterosexual and are often described as young and friendless introverts estimates of the size of incel communities during 20182020 varied it ranged from the thousands to tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands a statistical analysis of the largest incel forum shows that only a few hundred accounts made up the vast majority of forum posts during all of 2021 and most of 2022 incel communities are largely made up of emerging adults who feel they have not met their sexual milestones on time approximately half of incels live with their parents or grandparents many sources describe incels as predominantly white in 2018 sociologist ross haenfler was quoted in the washington post describing them as primarily white in 2018 heidi beirich of the southern poverty law center echoed this to nbc news saying they are young frustrated white males in their late teens into their early twenties who are having a hard time adjusting to adulthood in june 2019 jaki and colleagues publishing linguistic analysis of a large incel forum in the journal of language aggression and conflict contended that contrary to what is often reported there was no definitive evidence that the group is predominantly white and that it is impossible to say whether the majority of the incel forum's users are white men but our data implies that this may be less true than expected they suggested that the various mentions of race on the forum may reflect to some extent the ethnic variety of the forum hoffman and colleagues publishing in studies in conflict terrorism reported that a march 2020 survey of the same forum determined that most respondents self-identified as caucasian a 2024 survey of self-identified incels by researchers from the university of texas found that incels tended to be slightly center-left they are significantly left in questions about homosexuality corporate profits and welfare benefits in a 2023 study researchers from the university of texas ran a poll of self-reported incels which found that 6358 of those who responded identified as white a smaller percentage than non-incels in the study they found that 45 of incels who responded leaned to the left on the political spectrum 175 were centrists and 389 leaned to the right showing no differences between the incel and the control group of the study self-identified incels are mainly located in north america and europe there are also incel communities for people outside the anglosphere such as the italian website il forum dei brutti the english language forums also receive much traffic from non-anglophone countries in 2020 research by the swedish defence research agency foi on the three largest incel forums found that they had a total of about 20000 users with only about 1000 who post actively the foi found that between 46 and 73 of the visitors to the forums originated from sweden though they caution this may not be accurate given the use of personal vpns some media outlets depict incels as unemployed or neet not in education employment or training and living with parents female incels the first incel website alana's involuntary celibacy project was gender-inclusive there have been more contemporary female-specific incel or femcel communities such as rtrufemcels and its successor thepinkpill as of february 2020update the most popular female incel forum was the rtrufemcels subreddit with over 22000 members it was banned in january 2021 for violating reddit's rules against promoting hate another subreddit reportedly associated with self-identified female incels is rvindicta which contains beauty advice there are hashtags pertaining to the idea of female incels in use on tiktok such as femcel femcelcore and femcelrights which as of 2022 have over 250 million views there are reported to be tens of thousands of women self-identifying as female incels on the internet there is disagreement in online incel communities on whether women can be incels with some claiming that male incels grossly outnumber female incels others claiming that it is impossible for women to be incels at all others claiming that only severely deformed women can be incels and others arguing that only unattractive women belonging to the bottom percentile in terms of appearance can be incels members of male incel communities often reject the concept of a female incel believing that all women can obtain sex from men and believing that self-identified female incels are voluntarily celibate members of male incel communities may also troll female incels in 2020 according to the anti-defamation league the majority of self-identified incels do not believe women can be incels journalists have written that outside of the female incels' own communities few believe women can be incels in 2021 m kelly wrote for the political research associates that members of incel communities point to the existence of female incels as an argument against criticisms of them as misogynist but that most incel communities do not accept them and ban them from using their forums female incel communities are generally overlooked within academic literature about incels like members of male incel communities female incel community members tend to believe that they are victims to their ugliness and think that only unattractive men will date them they call more attractive looking women staceys who they believe decrease their chance of having sexual contact with men similar to discussion of chads in male incel forums they have adopted the idea of the pink pill which has been likened to red pill and black pill terminology and which describes a belief that some women are considered undesirable and thus are unable to engage in sexual relationships due to society's focus on certain aspects of female attractiveness members of female incel communities are more likely to self-blame rather than blaming men for their dating and sexual difficulties this may be due to gender stereotypes such as the belief that women do not have a natural need for sex some women identifying as incels believe they could have casual sex but fear it would only be from men who would abuse or disrespect them within online female incel communities misogyny and an impossible feminine beauty ideal are also perceived as reasons for female celibacy many other women have similar problems but do not self-identify as female incels some female incel communities have been critical of body positivity and mainstream feminism viewing them as unhelpful to female incels in 2022 a former member of the rtrufemcels community was quoted in the atlantic saying i'd rather be able to talk about being ugly than just try to convince myself that i'm pretty in 2022 an expert in psychology interviewed by el país characterized these communities as overly insular and skeptical of outsiders who are deemed normies in what she described as cognitive inflexibility she stated that us culture is less sociable in spain female incels would have completely different characteristics i don't think it would have the same number of followers to begin with because in spain we are more encouraging of interpersonal relationships and the development of social skills women who identify as incels share some similarities with their male counterparts such as belief that physical appearance is the most important factor in finding a partner in other ways they tend to be different for example according to journalist isabelle kohn in 2020 rather than being angry at the men who reject them they empathize with the men for not wanting to date them kohn notes the tendency for women identifying as incels to turn their rage inwards rather than outwards like males in 2020 journalist arwa mahdawi hypothesized that the fact that females who identify as incels do not go on violent rampages like some of their male counterparts is the most obvious reason why they have not received much attention in mainstream media in february 2020 kohn wrote that she could find mountains of academic papers on male incels but none on female incels she says the assumption that female incels do not exist adds to their pain in 2024 continued neglect of research on female incels was reported mental health see also mental disorders and gender involuntary celibacy is not a medical or psychological condition some people who identify as incel have physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as depression anxiety autism and body dysmorphic disorder a 2022 study found that self-identified incels had higher rates of depression anxiety and formal mental diagnoses than the general population 95 reported depression and 93 reported anxiety 38 had clinical diagnoses some posters to incel forums attribute their inability to find a partner to physical or mental ailments while some others attribute it to extreme introversion many of those identifying as incels engage in self-diagnosis of mental health issues members of incel communities often discourage posters who post about mental illness from seeing therapists or otherwise seeking treatment some members of incel communities with severe depression are also suicidal some members encourage suicidal members to kill themselves sometimes recommending that they commit acts of mass violence before doing so mass murders and violence timeline of violence committed or suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate or whose statements align with incel ideologies mass murders and other violent attacks have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate or whose statements align with incel ideologies other intended attacks by such individuals have been thwarted by police before being carried out 2000s on august 4 2009 george sodini opened fire at an la fitness health club in collier township a suburb of pittsburgh pennsylvania three women were murdered and nine other people were injured before sodini killed himself he purportedly expressed sexual frustration and complained of constant rejections by women on a website registered in his name sodini and his actions have been embraced and glorified by some members of incel communities who sometimes refer to incel violence as going sodini 2010s on may 23 2014 elliot rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others before killing himself in isla vista california near the campus of university of california santa barbara these killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and youtube videos in which he detailed his involuntary celibacy and discussed how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women he had been an active member of a community popular among incels called puahate short for pickup artist hate and referenced it several times in his manifesto although puahate shut down soon after the attack rodger became something of a martyr to some communities that remained and to some of those that emerged later it is common to see references to er in incel forums and mass violence by incels is regularly referred to as going er rodger has been referenced by the perpetrators or suspected perpetrators of several other mass killings and is one of several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities on october 1 2015 chris harper-mercer killed nine people and injured eight others before killing himself in a shooting at the umpqua community college campus in roseburg oregon he left a manifesto at the scene outlining his interest in other mass murders including the isla vista killings his anger at not having a girlfriend and his animus towards the world in his journal writings he had related to elliot rodger and other mass shooters describing them as people who stand with the gods before the attack when someone on an online message board had speculated harper-mercer was saving himself for someone special harper-mercer had replied 'involuntarily so several hours before the shooting someone suspected to be harper-mercer posted a threat to a pacific northwest college to r9k a 4chan board with many incel posters on july 31 2016 sheldon bentley robbed and killed an unconscious man in an alleyway in edmonton alberta during his trial bentley said he killed the man by stomping on his abdomen because he was

shooting at aztec high school where he had previously been a student he had used the pseudonym elliot rodger on several online forums and praised the supreme gentleman a term rodger had used to describe himself which has since become a common reference among incel communities atchison had also posted far-right content online on february 14 2018 nikolas cruz killed seventeen people and injured seventeen others in a shooting at stoneman douglas high school in parkland florida allegedly also motivated by other extremist views cruz had previously posted online that elliot rodger will not be forgotten after an april 23 2018 vehicle-ramming attack in toronto ontario alek minassian was convicted of 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder shortly before the attack minassian had allegedly posted on facebook that the incel rebellion has already begun and applauded rodger the term incel rebellion is sometimes used interchangeably with the term beta uprising which refers to a violent response to incels' perceived sexual deprivation following the attack a poster on a website created to supersede rincels wrote about minassian i hope this guy wrote a manifesto because he could be our next new saint following the attack police claimed that minassian had been radicalized by incel communities a video interview was released in september 2019 showing minassian being interrogated by police shortly after the attacks in the video minassian is shown telling police that he was a virgin and that he was motivated by a resentment of chads and staceys as well as women who gave their love and affection to obnoxious brutes rather than to him the video also showed minassian saying that he hoped the alleged attack would inspire future masses to join me in committing acts of violence as a part of the beta uprising the judge who found minassian guilty on all counts wrote in her decision that minassian had attempted to tie his attack to the incel community as a way of increasing his notoriety and that working out his exact motivation for this attack is close to impossible she found that minassian had lie to the police about much of the incel motivation he talked about and that the incel movement was not in fact a primary driving force behind the attack on november 2 2018 scott beierle killed two women and injured four women and a man

rodger was arrested on federal charges after allegedly videotaping himself approaching women sitting outside a restaurant in manhattan new york and telling them he was going to detonate a bomb the man had previously been arrested several times for harassing others often while recording or livestreaming and for multiple assaults with pepper spray in july 2021 a 21-year-old self-identified incel from ohio was charged with attempting a hate crime and illegally possessing a machine gun the man was a frequent poster on a popular incel website where he wrote posts venerating elliot rodger he wrote a manifesto in which he expressed his desire to slaughter women and in another document he allegedly wrote about his goals to kill 3000 people in a mass casualty attack on august 12 2021 jake davison a 22-year-old man who referenced inceldom in online videos and expressed similar views perpetrated a mass shooting in plymouth england he killed five people including his mother and injured two others before killing himself on december 27 2021 an individual who harboured views common with incels lyndon mcleod whose pen name was roman mcclay committed the 2021 denver and lakewood shootings murdering five people before being killed by a police officer on may 6 2023 33-year-old self-identified incel mauricio martinez garcia went on a spree shooting in a mall in allen texas garcia killed eight people and injured at least seven others before he was killed by a police officer criticism of the subculture incel communities have been criticized in the media and by researchers as violent misogynist and extremist keegan hankes a senior research analyst working for the southern poverty law center has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums play a very large role in the radicalization of their members and describes incel forums as having more violent rhetoric than i'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites journalist david futrelle has described incel communities as violently misogynistic and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups psychologist and sex researcher james cantor has described incels as a group of people who usually lack sufficient social skills and find themselves very frustrated he has said that in incel forums when they're surrounded by other people with similar frustrations they kind of lose track of what typical discourse is and they drive themselves into more and more extreme beliefs senior research fellow at the institute for strategic dialogue isd amarnath amarasingam has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace saying under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence in august 2018 another researcher at the isd jacob davey compared the radicalization of men in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders and to online campaigns convincing people to join isil speaking about their feelings of entitlement to sex davey said the attitude can go as far as the justification of rape while generally agreeing with critics' concerns about misogyny and other negative characteristics in the incel subculture some commentators have been more sympathetic in april 2018 economist robin hanson wrote a blog post likening access to sex with access to income writing that he found it puzzling that similar concern had not been shown to incels as to low-income individuals hanson was criticized by some for discussing sex as if it was a commodity others wrote more positively about his opinions in may 2018 the new york times columnist ross douthat wrote a similarly controversial op-ed titled the redistribution of sex in which he suggested sex robots and sex workers would inevitably be called upon to satisfy incels' sexual desires some commentators wrote articles agreeing with this view including toby young who agreed that sex robots could be a workable solution others criticized the column for objectifying women and for legitimizing the incel ideology journalist zack beauchamp has expressed concern about other types of harm inflicted by incels that may be lost in the attention paid specifically to mass violence he points to forum posts in which users brag about yelling at catfishing and sexually assaulting women university of portsmouth lecturer lisa sugiura has described incel forums as a networked misogyny and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of hate speech but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men some sociological research on incel communities has analyzed them as a hybrid masculinity in which privileged men distance themselves from hegemonic masculinity while simultaneously reproducing it of platforms providing services to incel communities criticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content including reddit which banned the rincels community in 2017 and banned most of the remaining incel communities in september 2019 but is still home to some identifying as incels and twitter cloudflare which provides services including ddos protection caching and obsfucation of the source host of the content has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against downtime even when webhosts have terminated service of reporting and research reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its breathless coverage for normalizing incel communities by describing them only as sexually frustrated and for directing readers to incel communities some reporting has also been criticized for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length or for victim blaming by implying that women who had rejected the attackers' romantic or sexual advances held some responsibility for provoking the attacks those who have written sympathetically about incels have faced criticism for legitimizing the incel ideology such as from samantha cole in vice who condemned media outlets who cove and amplif toxic internet culture as if it's valid ideology in a 2021 report published by the political research associates think tank m kelly wrote about recent attempts by various self-identified incels to rebrand their communities and stated that incels' attempts to reframe their identity have also been helped along by researchers journalists and 'counter-violent extremism' experts who in their attempts to investigate and understand incels have given them larger more mainstream platforms these new platforms have allowed self-identified incels to reframe the public narrative about them minimize the threat their community poses and have amplifiedor even endorsedtheir hate-laced grievances centering their self-perceived victimhood at the hands of women who deny them sex kelly criticized a podcast titled the incel project for platforming incel ideologies without challenging or fact-checking their statements she said the creator naama kates was no longer just reporting on incels' misogyny but justifying and sharing it with the world kelly criticized the international center for study of violent extremism icsve who published several reports on incels co-authored by kates and by the founder and lead moderator of a major incel forum writing that while previous icsve reports have drawn from primary data including interviews and surveys with members of the community being studied this seems to be the first timeat icsve or in academic research more broadlythat someone actively involved in a community that regularly expresses bigoted or violent ideology has co-authored the resulting study portrayals in fiction in his debut novel whatever 1994 french writer michel houellebecq seems to portray early examples of incels however the term did not yet exist at the time neither did the online communities the unnamed 30-year-old protagonist looks unattractive lacks social skills and suffers from depression which means that despite his excellent job as an it professional he is not popular with women things are much worse for his colleague who is downright ugly and still a virgin at 28 the main character tries to seduce his friend into killing a young woman who has rejected him which his friend refuses at the last moment in this novel the main protagonist philosophizes about the disastrous consequences of the sexual revolution because of sexual liberalism the market mechanism has
