This is a project that collects data from the Top 25 Wikipedia articles of the week using a webscraper, then organizes and visualizes that data via tools like NumPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Feel free to look around and also play with the data yourself.
If you'd like to recollect data to be updated to your time, be sure to uncomment the lines in main.py.
